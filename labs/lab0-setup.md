## Setting up your environment (08/30/24)

You will need to set up (or make sure you have access to) the following:

1. [Unix shell](../howtos/accessUnixCommandLine.md);
2. [Git](../howtos/installGit.md);
3. [Quarto](../howtos/installQuarto.md);
4. [Python](../howtos/accessPython.md);
5. A text editor or IDE of your choice.

After making sure you have access to all these 5 tools, it may be a good idea to go through the tutorial on [unix](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-unix-basics/) and (possibly) [unix commands](https://www.unixtutorial.org/basic-unix-commands). You can do this on your own or in the Lab section on Friday 08/30.

Attending Lab 0 is optional. If you successfully set up your environment to have all the listed tools, you don't need to attend. You are welcome to attend to ask for help with the setup or to help your classmates with setting up their environments.

You are also welcome to come and ask for help on using any of these 5 tools/systems (especially shell and unix commands this week), but priority will be given to environment setup questions.

Reach out to us on Ed with any unresolved problems or if you discover something that needs to be changed with our howtos and instructions.
