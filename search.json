    "text": "Windows 10 has a powerful new feature that allows a full Linux system to be installed and run from within Windows. This is incredibly useful for building/testing code in Linux, without having a dedicated Linux machine, but it poses strange new behaviors as two very different operating systems coexist in one place. Initially, this document mirrors the Windows Install tutorial, showing you how to install Ubuntu and setting up R, RStudio, and LaTex. Then, we cover some of the issues of running two systems together, starting with finding files, finding the Ubuntu subsystem, and file modifications.",

    "text": "Installing Ubuntu\nThere are 2 parts to installing a Linux subsystem in Windows. I will write this using Ubuntu as the example, as it is my preferred Linux distro, but several others are provided by Windows.\nSources:\n\nOfficial Windows Instructions\nUbuntu Update Instructions\n\n\n1) Enable Linux Subsystem\nBy default, the Linux subsystem is an optional addition in Windows. This feature has to be enabled prior to installing Linux. There are two ways to do it.\n\nCMD Line\nThe simplest way to enable the Linux subsystem is through PowerShell.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator\nRun the following (on one line):\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\nRestart the computer\n\nGUI\nIf you don’t wish to use PowerShell, you can work your way through the control panel and turn on the Linux subsystem.\n\nOpen the settings page through the search bar\nGo to Programs and Features\nFind Turn Windows Features on or off on the right side\nEnable the Windows Subsystem for Linux option\nRestart the computer\n\n\n\n\n2) Install Linux Subsystem\nOnce the Linux subsystem feature has been enabled, there are multiple methods to download and install the Linux distro you want. I highly recommend installing Ubuntu from the Microsoft store. There are several other flavors available as well, but Ubuntu is generally the easiest to learn and the most well supported.\n\nOpen the Microsoft Store\nSearch for Ubuntu\n\nYou’re looking for the highest number followed by LTS, currently 20.04 LTS (or 18.04 LTS is fine too). This is the current long-term-release, meaning it will be supported for the next 5 years.\n\nClick on the tile, then click Get, and this should start the installation.\nFollow the prompts to install Ubuntu.\n\nAfter installing Ubuntu, it is advisable to update it. This is something you should do on a regular basis.\n\nOpen a Bash terminal.\nType sudo apt update to update your local package database.\nType sudo apt upgrade to upgrade your installed packages.",

Any files created under the Linux subsystem, only modify them with Linux tools. In contrast, you can create files in the Windows system and modify them with both Windows or Linux tools. There could be file permission issues because Windows doesn’t have the same concept of file permissions as Linux. So, if you intend to work on files using both Linux and Windows, create the files in the C drive under Windows, and you should be safe to edit them with either OS.",

You’ll need to go into the statsmodels source code (see Unit 5). Also note that the following cases may involve functions, classes, and class methods. Be sure to be clear to say which of those you are talking about and if it’s a class, describe any inheritance structure.\n\nFor this subpart only, consider doing import statsmodels. What is in the statsmodels namespace that is created? Where (what module file) is the version number for statsmodels stored in? What is the absolute path to the package on the machine you are working on?\nThe remaining subparts all relate to using the standard import statsmodels.api as sm invocation. First, describe briefly what happens when this is run (what files are accessed). Then, describe what kind of object MICE is, how it is imported and where it is found. Do the same for GLM.\nConsider sm.gam. What is in the namespace? Describe how the importing works and in what modules the objects in the namespace are defined.\nConsider sm.distributions.monotone_fn_inverter. What is it, how it is imported and what file it is defined in?\n\nHints:\n\ngrep -R &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;directory&gt; will search all files within a directory recursively.\nAs you work on this, you may want to be able to modify one or more of the __init__.py or other files to better understand what is happening (e.g., by commenting out a line of code or adding a print statement). A good way to do this is to create a Conda environment in which statsmodels is installed, so you isolate any changes you make, e.g., conda create -n test_env python=3.12 statsmodels. Then you can edit code files in the environment and when you start Python and import statsmodels, you should see the effects of your changes. Alternatively, you could use the debugger to set breakpoint(s) in a file in the package.\n\nThe website Commission on Presidential Debates has the text from recent debates between the candidates for President of the United States. (As a bit of background for those of you not familiar with the US political system, there are usually three debates between the Republican and Democratic candidates at which they are asked questions so that US voters can determine which candidate they would like to vote for.) Your task is to process the information and produce data on the debates. Note that while I present the problem below as subparts (a)-(d), your solution does not need to be divided into subparts in the same way, but you do need to make clear in your solution where and how you are doing what. For the purposes of this problem, please work on the the debates I’ve selected (see code below) for the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. (I’ve tried to select debates that cover domestic policy in whole or in part to control one source of variation, namely the topic of the debate.) I’ll call each individual response by a candidate to a question a “chunk”. A chunk might just be a few words or might be multiple paragraphs.\nThe goal of this problem is two-fold: first to give you practice with regular expressions and string processing and the second to have you thinking about writing well-structured, readable code (similar to question 4 of PS1). You can choose to use either a functional programming approach or an object-oriented approach. I strongly recommend that you use the approach that you are less familiar with so as to gain more experience. Please think about writing short, modular functions or methods. Explore the use of map, list comprehension or other techniques to avoid having a lot of nested for loops. Think carefully about how to structure your objects to store the spoken chunks so that the structure works well with your functions/methods. Note that for this problem, for the sake of time, you do not need extensive docstrings, but it should still be clear what each function does. In parts (a)-(c), add simple sanity checks that you are getting reasonable results.\nGiven that in earlier problem sets, you already worked on downloading and processing HTML, I’m giving you the code (in the file ps/ps3prob3.py in the class repository) to download the HTML and do some initial processing, so you can dive right into processing the actual debate text.\n\nConvert the text so that for each debate, the spoken text is split up into individual chunks of text spoken by each speaker (including the moderator). If there are two chunks in a row spoken by a candidate, combine them into a single chunk. Make sure that any formatting and non-spoken text (e.g., the tags for ‘Laughter’ and ‘Applause’) is stripped out. Report the number of chunks per speaker.\nExtract the individual words. To do the extraction I suggest you use existing Python natural language processing packages that can “tokenize” text, but you’re also welcome to use regular expressions, particularly if you want to practice them more. Doing this with 100% accuracy will be hard (particularly for spoken text). Try to handle various issues, but don’t try to be perfect.\nFor each candidate, for each debate, count the number of words and characters and compute the average word length for each candidate. Compare these between candidates and over time in some basic fashion.\nDo some checking of your functions on simple test inputs. For the sake of time, you don’t need to set up formal testing, and this doesn’t need to be extensive.\n(Extra credit) For each candidate, count the following words or word stems (feel free to replace some or all of these with words or expressions of your choice) and store in a data structure: I, we, America{,n}, democra{cy,tic}, republic, Democrat{,ic}, Republican, free{,dom}, terror{,ism}, safe{,r,st,ty}, {Jesus, Christ, Christian}. Make a plot or two and comment briefly on the results.\n\nNow sketch out a design for a functional programming (FP) approach (if your solution to Problem 2 used OOP) or an OOP approach (if your solution to Problem 2 used functional programming). If you’re designing an OOP approach, decide what the classes would be and the fields and methods of those classes. If you’re designing a FP approach, decide what the functions would be and what inputs/output they would use. To be clear, you do not have to write any of the code for the methods/classes/functions; the idea is just to design the code. As your response in the OOP case, for each class, please provide a bulleted list of methods and bulleted list of fields and for each item briefly comment what the purpose is. Or in the FP case, for each function, provide a bulleted list of inputs and output and briefly comment on the purpose of each function.",

    "section": "Problems",
    "text": "Problems\n\nThis problem asks you to use Dask to process some Wikipedia traffic data and makes use of tools discussed in Section on October 11. The files in /scratch/users/paciorek/wikistats/dated_2017_small/dated (on the SCF) contain data on the number of visits to different Wikipedia pages on November 4, 2008 (which was the date of the US election in 2008 in which Barack Obama was elected). The columns are: date, time, language, webpage, number of hits, and page size. (Note that the Unit 7 Dask bag example and Question 2 below use a larger set of the same data.)\n\nIn an interactive session on the SCF Linux cluster (ideally on the low partition, but if necessary on the high partition), start an interactive session on one of the cluster nodes using srun (as discussed in section). Request four cores. Then follow these steps:\n\nCopy the data files to a subdirectory of the /tmp directory of the machine your interactive session is running on. (Keep your code files in your home directory.) Putting the files on the local hard drive of the machine you are computing on reduces the amount of copying data across the network (in the situation where you read the data into your program multiple times) and should speed things up in step ii.\nWrite efficient Python code to do the following: Using the dask package as seen in Unit 6, with either map or a list of delayed tasks, write code that, in parallel, reads in the space-delimited files and filters to only the rows that refer to pages where “Barack_Obama” appears in the page title (column 4). You can use the code from Unit 6 as a template. Collect all the results into a single data frame. In your srun invocation and in your code, please use four cores in your parallelization so that other cores are saved for use by other users/students. IMPORTANT: before running the code on the full set of data, please test your code on a small subset first (and test your function on a single input file serially).\nTabulate the number of hits for each hour of the day and make a (time-series) plot showing how the number of visits varied over the day (I don’t care how you do this - using either Python or R is fine.). Note that the time zone is UTC/GMT, so you won’t actually see the evening times when Obama’s victory was announced - we’ll see that in Question 2. Feel free to do this step outside the context of the parallelization. You’ll want to use datetime functions from Pandas or the datetime package to manipulate the timing information (i.e., don’t use string manipulations).\nRemove the files from /tmp.\n\nTips:\n\nIn general, keep in mind various ideas from Unit 2 about reading data from files. A couple things that posed problems when I was prototyping this in using pandas.read_csv were that there are lines with fewer than six fields and that there are lines that have quotes that should be treated as part of the text of the fields and not as separators. To get things to work ok, I needed to set the dtype to str for the first two fields (for ease of dealing with the date/time info later) but NOT set the dtype for the other fields, and to use the quoting argument to handle the literal quotes.\nWhen starting your srun session, please include the flag --mem-per-cpu=5G when submitting the Slurm job. In general one doesn’t need to request memory when submitting jobs to the SCF cluster but there is a weird interaction between Dask and Slurm that I don’t quite understand that requires this.\n\nNow replicate steps (i) and (ii) but using sbatch to submit your job as a batch job to the SCF Linux cluster, where step (ii) involves running Python from the command line (e.g., python your_file.py. You don’t need to make the plot again. As discussed here in the Dask documentation, put your Python/Dask code inside an if __name__ == '__main__' block.\nNote that you need to copy the files to /tmp in your submission script, so that the files are copied to /tmp on whichever node of the SCF cluster your job gets run on. Make sure that as part of your sbatch script you remove the files in /tmp at the end of the script. (Why? In general /tmp is cleaned out when a machine is rebooted, but this might take a while to happen and many of you will be copying files to the same hard drive so otherwise /tmp could run out of space.)\n\nConsider the Wikipedia traffic data for October 15-November 15, 2008 (already available in /var/local/s243/wikistats/dated_2017_sub on all of the SCF cluster nodes in the low or high partitions). As in Question 1, explore the variation over time in the number of visits to Barack Obama-related Wikipedia sites, based on searching for “Barack_Obama” on English language Wikipedia pages. You should use Dask with distributed data structures to do the reading and filtering, as seen in Unit 7. Then group by day-hour (it’s fine to do the grouping/counting in Python in a way that doesn’t use Dask data structures). You can do this either in an interactive session using srun or a batch job using sbatch. And if you use srun, you can run Python itself either interactively or as a background job. Time how long it takes to do the Dask part of the computations to get a sense for how much time is involved working with this much data. Once you have done the filtering and gotten the counts for each day-hour, you can simply use standard Python or R code on your laptop to do some plotting to show how the traffic varied over the days of the full month-long time period and particularly over the hours of November 3-5, 2008 (election day was November 4 and Obama’s victory was declared at 11 pm Eastern time on November 4).\nNotes:\n\nThere are various ways to do this using Dask bags or Dask data frames, but I think the easiest in terms of using code that you’ve seen in Unit 7 is to read the data in and do the filtering using a Dask bag and then convert the Dask bag to a Dask dataframe to do the grouping and summarization. Alternatively you should be able to use foldby() from dask.bag, but figuring out what arguments to pass to foldby() is a bit involved.\nMake sure to test your code on a portion of the data before doing computation on the full dataset. Reading and filtering the whole dataset will take something like 30 minutes with 16 cores. You MUST test on a small number of files on your laptop or on one of the stand-alone SCF machines (e.g., radagast, gandalf, arwen) before trying to run the code on the full 40 GB (zipped) of data. For testing, the files are also available in /scratch/users/paciorek/wikistats/dated_2017_sub.\nWhen doing the full computation via your Slurm job submission:\n\nDon’t copy the data (unlike in Question 1) to avoid overloading our disks with each student having their own copy. Just use the data from /var/local/s243/wikistats/dated_2017_sub.\nPlease do not use more than 16 cores in your Slurm job submissions so that cores are available for your classmates. If your job is stuck in the queue you may want to run it with 8 rather than 16 cores.\nAs discussed in Section, when you use sbatch to submit a job to the SCF cluster or srun to run interactively, you should be using the --ntasks-per-node flag (--cpus-per-task is fine too) to specify the number of cores that your computation will use. In your Python code, you can then either hard-code that same number of cores as the number of workers or (better) you can use the SLURM_NTASKS shell environment variable to tell Dask how many workers to start (or SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK if using --cpus-per-task).\n\n\nSQL practice using the Stack Overflow database.\n\nFind all the users (including their displayname) who have asked but never answered a question. You’re welcome to set up your solution using views, but you should not need to. In your solution, provide as many separate queries as needed to illustrate all of the following SQL functionality: a subquery in the WHERE statement, a subquery in the FROM statement, a set operation using INTERSECT, UNION or EXCEPT), and an outer join (note that SQLite does not have a right outer join). Check the count of the number of results from the different queries to make sure they are the same.\nNote that for reasons I haven’t looked into, both the questions and answers tables contain rows where the ownerid is NULL. These can mess up certain versions of the queries I’m asking you to create. So first create views that omit those cases from those two tables. (One could do the omitting within the main query, but this is a good situation for using views to make the main query easier to understand.)\nDo the different approaches vary much in terms of how much time they take? What about using SQLite versus DuckDB?",

You will need to learn more advanced use of git and github towards the end of the semester when you start working with other team members on the same project.\n\nChunk options\nLike RMarkdown, quarto allows for several execution options to be set per document and per chunk. Spend some time getting familiar with the various options, and keep this link handy when you are working on the first few problem sets.\nDepending on what’s required in the problem sets, you may need to set eval to false (just print out code) or error to true (print errors and don’t halt rendering of the document). Some of the other options may be useful for controlling how the code gets printed.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nQuarto succeeds in rendering html but fails at rendering pdf\nInstall tinytex via quarto install tinytex\n\n\nProblems running and rendering bash commands in quarto\nIf you are using the knitr engine, you should be able to tag your code chunks in quarto with {bash} and use verbatim bash commands. If you are using the Jupyter engine, the {python} tag should be used instead and every line containing a bash command should be prefixed with an exclamation mark (!).\n\n\nQuarto rendering (or python execution) works from the terminal but not from the IDE\nYou can go to the settings in your IDE and point it to the specific python installation that you find when you execute which python in the terminal.\n\n\nQuarto rendering (or python execution) works from the IDE but not from the terminal\nYou can fix the quarto configuration by setting the environment variable QUARTO_PYTHON to the correct python path or by running quarto check. Restarting the IDE may also help if you had just installed something in the other environment.\n\n\nQuarto rendering fails to find a Python package\nIt’s a good idea to test that you can import packages such as numpy when a document is rendered. If that fails, either you haven’t installed the package in Python or Quarto is using a different Python installation than the one in which you installed the package. See the items above.\n\n\nPushing to git fails with message “Make sure you configure your ‘user.email’ and ‘user.name’ in git”\nFollow the suggested course of action in the error message to configure your email and name, then push again.",

The main goal of testing is to make sure the main expected cases are behaving correctly.\nSometimes your code doesn’t do what you expect or want it to do, and it’s not clear just by reading through it, what the problem is.\nIn interpreted languages (especially those with interactive shells like python) one can sometimes run the code piece by piece and inspect the state of the variables.\nIf the code involves a loop or a function, a common practice is to judiciously place a few print statements that dump the state of some variables to the terminal so that you can spot the problem by tracing through it.\nWhen the code involves multiple functions and complex state, this strategy starts to break down. This is where you start rolling up your sleeves and invoking a debugger!\nDebugging can be a slow process, so you typically start a debugging session by deciding which line in your code you would like to start tracing the behavior from, and you place a breakpoint. Then you can have the debugger run the program up to that point and stop at it, allowing you to:\n1- inspect the current state of variables 2- step through the code line by line 3- step over or into functions as they are called 4- resume program execution",

    "text": "Advanced debugging\nSome bugs are really tricky to catch. Those are typically the bugs that happen very rarely, and in unclear circumstances. In statistical computing and data analysis settings these might be conditions that happen in iterative algorithms sometimes, but not very often, and can be hard to reproduce.\nOne way to deal with these bugs is to start the debugging session with placing one or more conditional breakpoints. These are similar to regular breakpoints but are not going to cause the debugger to stop the execution of the program and hand you the controls unless a specific condition (that you specify) evaluates to true as the program is executing that particular line of code. You may use some conditions that are similar to what you would place in an assert statement (conditions that shouldn’t happen) or any other conditions that you think may be associated with the occurrence of the anomalous behavior your are debugging.",

    "text": "Integrated GUI debugger (with VS Code)\nToday we will experiment with the visual debugging tools integrated with IDEs. We will do that in VS Code (unless you have another IDE with debugger integration). We will load a piece of code, go through it to understand what it does, then try to discover the problem with it and fix it.\nHere’s a piece of code that implements the binary search algorithm to locate the first occurrence of a number in a list of numbers:\n\nimport math\ndef binary_search(lst, T):\n    L = 0\n    R = len(lst) - 1\n    while L &lt; R:\n        m = math.floor((L + R) / 2)\n        if lst[m] &lt;= T:\n            L = m + 1\n        else:\n            R = m - 1\n    if lst[L] == T:\n        return L\n    return -1\n\nThere are a couple of things not quite right with this implementation, even though it will run and produce correct results for some cases.\nHere’s another piece of code implementing merge sort (also with some bugs in it):\n\ndef merge_sort(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    if n == 1:\n        return lst\n    return merge(merge_sort(lst[:n//2]), merge_sort(lst[n//2:]))\n\ndef merge(lst1, lst2):\n    merged = []\n    i, j = 0,0\n    while i &lt; len(lst1) and j &lt; len(lst2):\n        if i &lt; len(lst1) and j &lt; len(lst2) and lst1[i] &lt; lst2[j]:\n            merged.append(lst1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(lst1[j])\n            j += 1\n    while i &lt; len(lst1):\n        merged.append(lst1[i])\n        i += 1\n    while j &lt; len(lst2):\n            merged.append(lst2[j])\n            j += 1\n    return merged\n        \nmerge_sort([3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 3, 9, 12, 8])\n\nYou can use this to practice stepping inside functions, and thinking about recursion.\nIncidentally, if you first sort, then find, you can get the quantile of a particular value within a collection (you’ll need to adjust the binary search a little to achieve this).\nAlternatively you could start by implementing (without using any existing functions) a function that inverts the order of the words in a string, and debug it until it works.\nHere’s a version of this function with a couple of bugs injected, if you prefer to start from there:\n\ndef reverse_words(input):\n    working = list(input)\n    invert(working)\n    start = 0\n    for i, c in enumerate(working):\n        if c == ' ' and i != start:\n            invert(working, start, i)\n            start = i+1\n    return ''.join(working)\n\ndef invert(lst, start=None, end=None):\n    if None == start:\n        start = 0\n    if None == end:\n        end = len(lst)-1\n    \n    while start &lt; end:\n        tmp = lst[start]\n        lst[start] = lst[start]\n        lst[end] = tmp\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n\nreverse_words(\"These are my words.

    "text": "Post-mortem debugging\nA usual workflow to debug a piece of code that is crashing is to run it, investigate the exact location where the crash happens, add a breakpoint statement and rerun the code. Oftentimes, the bug is not deterministic or only happens at certain iterations inside a loop, so a conditional breakpoint will have to be engineered. Post-mortem debugging simplifies such a workflow, sometimes drastically, by running the program until it crashes and automatically placing the user into a debugging session immediately before the crash. To enter post-mortem debugging automatically, a script that exits abnormally can be called via python -m pdb myscript.py. Alternatively, one may import pdb and call pdb.pm() after a function call crashes.",

    "text": "Course requirements and grading\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nCampus asks that I include this information about conflicts: Please notify me in writing by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). I will try my best to help you with making accommodations, but I cannot promise them in all cases. In the event there is no mutually-workable solution, you may be dropped from the class.\nThe main conflict that would be a problem would be the quizzes, whose dates I will determine in late August / early September.\nQuizzes are in-person. There is no remote option, and the only make-up accommodations I will make are for illness or serious personal issues. Do not schedule any travel that may conflict with a quiz.\n\n\nCourse grades\nThe grade for this course is primarily based on assignments due every 1-2 weeks, two quizzes (likely in early-mid October and mid-late November), and a final group project. I will also provide extra credit questions on some problem sets. There is no final exam.\n\n50% of the grade is based on the problem sets,\n25% on the quizzes,\n15% on the project, and\n10% on your class participation:\n\nyour responses to the in-class (and occasionally in-advance-of-class) Google forms questions,\ncompletion of occasional non-problem set assignments (including assignments in lab section), and\nsubstantive contribution to discussions on Ed (i.e., responding to your classmates’ questions and asking thoughtful questions about course material).\n\n\nGrades will generally be As and Bs. An A involves doing all the work, getting full credit on most of the problem sets, doing well on the quizzes, and doing a thorough job on the final project.\n\n\nProblem sets\nWe will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or post a question online at the last minute. Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of time for the assignments.\nThere are several rules for submitting your assignments.\n\nYou should prepare your assignments using Quarto.\nProblem set submission consists of both of the following:\n\nA PDF submitted electronically through Gradescope, by the start of class (10 am) on the due date, and\nAn electronic copy of the PDF, code files, and Quarto document pushed to your class GitHub repository, following the instructions to be provided by the GSI.\n\nOn-time submission will be determined based on the time stamp of when the PDF is submitted to Gradescope.\nAnswers should consist of textual response or mathematical expressions as appropriate, with key chunks of code embedded within the document. Function definitions would generally be placed in a separate .py code file. The function definitions and any extensive additional code should be provided as an appendix. Before diving into the code for a problem, you should say what the goal of the code is and your strategy for solving the problem. Raw code without explanation is not an appropriate solution. Please see our qualitative grading rubric for guidance. In general the rubric is meant to reinforce good coding practices and high-quality scientific communication.\nAny mathematical derivations may be done by hand and scanned with your phone if you prefer that to writing up LaTeX equations.\nYou must include a “Collaboration” section in which you indicate any other students you worked with. If you did not collaborate with anyone else, simply state that.\n\nNote: Quarto Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that allows one to embed Python and R code within an HTML document. Please see the SCF dynamics document tutorial; there will be additional information in the first section and on the first problem set.\n\n\nSubmitting assignments\nIn the first section (September 1), we’ll discuss how to submit your problem sets both on Gradescope and via your class GitHub repository, located at https://github.berkeley.edu/&lt;your_calnet_username&gt;.\n\n\nProblem set grading\nThe grading scheme for problem sets is as follows. Each problem set will receive a numeric score for (1) presentation and explanation of results, (2) technical accuracy of code or mathematical derivation, and (3) code quality (style, structure, reproducibility, and creativity). For each of these three components, the possible scores are:\n\n0 = no credit,\n1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all),\n2 = satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you did that didn’t completely/correctly solve or present/explain one or more problems), and\n3 = full credit.\n\nAgain, the qualitative grading rubric provides guidance on what we want to see for full credit.\nFor components #1 and #3, many of you will get a score of 2 for some problem sets as you develop good presentation and coding practices. You can still get an A in the class despite this.\nYour total score for the PS is a weighted sum of the scores for the three components. If you turn in a PS late, I’ll bump you down by two points (out of the available). If you turn it in really late (e.g., after we start grading them), I will bump you down by four points. No credit after solutions are distributed.\n\n\nFinal project\nThe final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4. I’ll assign an overall task, and you’ll be responsible for dividing up the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. You’ll need to use the Git version control system for working in your group.\n\n\nRules for working together and the campus honor code\nI encourage you to work together and help each other out. However, the problem set solutions you submit must be your own. What do I mean by that?\n\nYou should first try to figure out a given problem on your own. After that, if you’re stuck or want to explore alternative approaches or check what you’ve done, feel free to consult with your fellow students and with the GSI and me.\nWhat does “consult with a fellow student mean”? You can discuss a problem with another student, brainstorm approaches, and share code syntax (generally not more than one line) on how to do small individual coding tasks within a problem.\n\nYou should not ask another student for complete code or solutions, or look at their code/solution.\nYou should not share complete code or solutions with another student or on Ed Discussion.\n\nYou may use ChatGPT (or similar chatbots) for help with small sections of a problem (e.g., how to do some specific Python or bash task). You should not use ChatGPT to try to answer an entire question. You should carefully verify that the result is correct. For any code you submit based on such tools, you should be sure you understand (and could explain to someone else) in detail what the code does and how/why it works. I.e., these tools help us brainstorm; they don’t replace us thinking.\nYou must provide attribution for ideas obtained elsewhere, including other students and ChatGPT or similar chatbots.\n\nIf you got a specific idea for how to do part of a problem from a fellow student (or some other resource, including ChatGPT), you should note that in your solution in the appropriate place (for specific syntax ideas, note this in a code comment), just as you would cite a book or URL.\nIn addition, you MUST list in a Collaboration section on your problem set solution any fellow students who you worked/consulted with.\nYou do not need to cite any Ed Discussion posts nor any discussions with Chris or João.\n\nUltimately, your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own, and you’ll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else’s.\n\nPlease see the last section of this document for more information on the Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow.",

    "text": "Campus Honor Code\nThe following is the Campus Honor Code. With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding problem sets above – Chris.\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.\nCollaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one’s own independent work.\nCheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.\nPlagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html\nAcademic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional. There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.\nYour experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all.",

    "text": "Text and binary files\nIn general, files can be divided into text files and binary files. In both cases, information is stored as a series of bits. Recall that a bit is a single value in base 2 (i.e., a 0 or a 1), while a byte is 8 bits.\nA text file is one in which the bits in the file encode individual characters. Note that the characters can include the digit characters 0-9, so one can include numbers in a text file by writing down the digits needed for the number of interest. Examples of text file formats include CSV, XML, HTML, and JSON.\nText files may be simple ASCII files (i.e., files encoded using ASCII) or files in other encodings such as UTF-8, both covered in Section 5. ASCII files have 8 bits (1 byte) per character and can represent 128 characters (the 52 lower and upper case letters in English, 10 digits, punctuation and a few other things – basically what you see on a standard US keyboard). UTF-8 files have between 1 and 4 bytes per character.\nSome text file formats, such as JSON or HTML, are not easily interpretable/manipulable on a line-by-line basis (unlike, e.g., CSV), so they are not as amenable to processing using shell commands.\nA binary file is one in which the bits in the file encode the information in a custom format and not simply individual characters. Binary formats are not (easily) human readable but can be more space-efficient and faster to work with (because it can allow random access into the data rather than requiring sequential reading). The meaning of the bytes in such files depends on the specific binary format being used and a program that uses the file needs to know how the format represents information. Examples of binary files include netCDF files, Python pickle files, R data (e.g., .Rda) files, , and compiled code files.\nNumbers in binary files are usually stored as 8 bytes per number. We’ll discuss this much more in Unit 8.",

    "section": "Common file types",
    "text": "Common file types\nHere are some of the common file types, some of which are text formats and some of which are binary formats.\n\n‘Flat’ text files: data are often provided as simple text files. Often one has one record or observation per row and each column or field is a different variable or type of information about the record. Such files can either have a fixed number of characters in each field (fixed width format) or a special character (a delimiter) that separates the fields in each row. Common delimiters are tabs, commas, one or more spaces, and the pipe (|). Common file extensions are .txt and .csv. Metadata (information about the data) are often stored in a separate file. CSV files are quite common, but if you have files where the data contain commas, other delimiters might be preferable. Text can be put in quotes in CSV files, and this can allow use of commas within the data. This is difficult to deal with from the command line, but read_table() in Pandas handles this situation.\n\nOne occasionally tricky difficulty is as follows. If you have a text file created in Windows, the line endings are coded differently than in UNIX. Windows uses a newline (the ASCII character \\n) and a carriage return (the ASCII character \\r) whereas UNIX uses onlyl a newline in UNIX). There are UNIX utilities (fromdos in Ubuntu, including the SCF Linux machines and dos2unix in other Linux distributions) that can do the necessary conversion. If you see \\^M at the end of the lines in a file, that’s the tool you need. Alternatively, if you open a UNIX file in Windows, it may treat all the lines as a single line. You can fix this with todos or unix2dos.\n\nIn some contexts, such as textual data and bioinformatics data, the data may be in a text file with one piece of information per row, but without meaningful columns/fields.\nData may also be in text files in formats designed for data interchange between various languages, in particular XML or JSON. These formats are “self-describing”; namely the metadata is part of the file. The lxml and json packages are useful for reading and writing from these formats. More in Section 4.\nYou may be scraping information on the web, so dealing with text files in various formats, including HTML. The requests and BeautifulSoup packages are useful for reading HTML.\nIn scientific contexts, netCDF (.nc) (and the related HDF5) are popular format for gridded data that allows for highly-efficient storage and contains the metadata within the file. The basic structure of a netCDF file is that each variable is an array with multiple dimensions (e.g., latitude, longitude, and time), and one can also extract the values of and metadata about each dimension. The netCDF4 package in Python nicely handles working with netCDF files.\nData may already be in a database or in the data storage format of another statistical package (Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). The Pandas package in Python has capabilities for importing Stata (read_stata), SPSS (read_spss), and SAS (read_sas) files, among others.\nFor Excel, there are capabilities to read an Excel file (see the read_excel function in Pandas), but you can also just go into Excel and export as a CSV file or the like and then read that into Python. In general, it’s best not to pass around data files as Excel or other spreadsheet format files because (1) Excel is proprietary, so someone may not have Excel and the format is subject to change, (2) Excel imposes limits on the number of rows, (3) one can easily manipulate text files such as CSV using UNIX tools, but this is not possible with an Excel file, (4) Excel files often have more than one sheet, graphs, macros, etc., so they’re not a data storage format per se.\nPython can easily interact with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.), querying the database using SQL and returning results to Python.

    "text": "CSV vs. specialized formats such as Parquet\nCSV is a common format (particularly in some disciplines/contexts) and has the advantages of being simple to understand, human readable, and readily manipulable by line-based processing tools such as shell commands. However, it has various disadvantages:\n\nstorage is by row, which will often mix values of different types;\nextra space is taken up by explicitly storing commas and newlines; and\none must search through the document to find a given row or value – e.g., to find the 10th row, we must search for the 9th newline and then read until the 10th newline.\n\nA popular file format that has some advantages over plain text formats such as CSV is Parquet. The storage is by column (actually in chunks of columns). This works well with how datasets are often structured in that a given field/variable will generally have values of all the same type and there may be many repeated values, so there are opportunities for efficient storage including compression. Storage by column also allows retrieval only of the columns that a user needs. As a result data stored in the Parquet format often takes up much less space than stored as CSV and can be queried much faster. Also note that data stored in Parquet will often be stored as multiple files.\nHere’s a brief exploration using a data file not in the class repository because of its size but available online here.\n\nimport time\n\n## Read from CSV.\nt0 = time.time()\ndata_from_csv = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'airline.csv'))\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n1.0188117027282715\n\n\n\n## Write out Parquet-formatted data.\ndata_from_csv.to_parquet(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'airline.parquet'))\n\n## Read from Parquet.\nt0 = time.time()\ndata_from_parquet = pd.read_parquet(os.path.join(\n                                    '..', 'data', 'airline.parquet'))\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.12586140632629395\n\n\nThe CSV file is 51 MB while the Parquet file is 8 MB.\n\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\", os.path.join(\"..\", \"data\", \"airline.csv\")])\nsubprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\", os.path.join(\"..\", \"data\", \"airline.parquet\")])\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 51480244 Aug 27 11:35 ../data/airline.csv\n\n\nCompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l', '../data/airline.csv'], returncode=0)\n\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 8153160 Sep  3 09:12 ../data/airline.parquet\n\n\nCompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l', '../data/airline.parquet'], returncode=0)",

They read in delimited files (CSV specifically in the latter case). The key arguments are the delimiter (the sep argument) and whether the file contains a header, a line with the variable names. We can use read_fwf() to read from a fixed width text file into a data frame.\nThe most difficult part of reading in such files can be dealing with how Pandas determines the types of the fields that are read in. While Pandas will try to determine the types automatically, it can be safer (and faster) to tell Pandas what the types are, using the dtype argument to read_table().\nLet’s work through a couple examples. Before we do that, let’s look at the arguments to read_table. Note that sep='' can use regular expressions (which would be helpful if you want to separate on any amount of white space, as one example).\n\ndat = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                    sep = ',', header = None)\ndat.dtypes.head()   # 'object' is string or mixed type\ndat.loc[0,1]     \ntype(dat.loc[0,1]) # string!\n## Whoops, there is an 'x', presumably indicating missingness:\ndat.loc[:,1].unique()\n\n0    object\n1    object\n2    object\n3    object\n4    object\ndtype: object\n\n\n'2336'\n\n\nstr\n\n\narray(['2336', '2124', '1830', '1833', '1600', '1578', '1187', '1005',\n       '918', '865', '871', '860', '883', '897', '898', '893', '913',\n       '870', '962', '880', '875', '884', '894', '836', '848', '885',\n       '851', '900', '861', '866', '867', '829', '853', '920', '877',\n       '908', '855', '845', '859', '856', '825', '828', '854', '847',\n       '840', '873', '822', '818', '838', '815', '813', '816', '849',\n       '802', '805', '792', '823', '808', '798', '800', '842', '809',\n       '807', '826', '810', '801', '794', '771', '796', '790', '787',\n       '775', '751', '783', '811', '768', '779', '795', '770', '821',\n       '830', '767', '772', '791', '781', '773', '777', '814', '778',\n       '782', '837', '759', '846', '797', '835', '832', '793', '803',\n       '834', '785', '831', '820', '812', '824', '728', '760', '762',\n       '753', '758', '764', '741', '709', '735', '749', '752', '761',\n       '750', '776', '766', '789', '763', '864', '858', '869', '886',\n       '844', '863', '916', '890', '872', '907', '926', '935', '933',\n       '906', '905', '912', '972', '996', '1009', '961', '952', '981',\n       '917', '1011', '1071', '1920', '3245', '3805', '3926', '3284',\n       '2700', '2347', '2078', '2935', '3040', '1860', '1437', '1512',\n       '1720', '1493', '1026', '928', '874', '833', '850', nan, 'x'],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\n\n## Let's treat 'x' as a missing value indicator.\ndat2 = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                     sep = ',', header = None, na_values = 'x')\ndat2.dtypes.head()\ndat2.loc[:,1].unique()\n\n0     object\n1    float64\n2    float64\n3    float64\n4    float64\ndtype: object\n\n\narray([2336., 2124., 1830., 1833., 1600., 1578., 1187., 1005.,  918.,\n        865.,  871.,  860.,  883.,  897.,  898.,  893.,  913.,  870.,\n        962.,  880.,  875.,  884.,  894.,  836.,  848.,  885.,  851.,\n        900.,  861.,  866.,  867.,  829.,  853.,  920.,  877.,  908.,\n        855.,  845.,  859.,  856.,  825.,  828.,  854.,  847.,  840.,\n        873.,  822.,  818.,  838.,  815.,  813.,  816.,  849.,  802.,\n        805.,  792.,  823.,  808.,  798.,  800.,  842.,  809.,  807.,\n        826.,  810.,  801.,  794.,  771.,  796.,  790.,  787.,  775.,\n        751.,  783.,  811.,  768.,  779.,  795.,  770.,  821.,  830.,\n        767.,  772.,  791.,  781.,  773.,  777.,  814.,  778.,  782.,\n        837.,  759.,  846.,  797.,  835.,  832.,  793.,  803.,  834.,\n        785.,  831.,  820.,  812.,  824.,  728.,  760.,  762.,  753.,\n        758.,  764.,  741.,  709.,  735.,  749.,  752.,  761.,  750.,\n        776.,  766.,  789.,  763.,  864.,  858.,  869.,  886.,  844.,\n        863.,  916.,  890.,  872.,  907.,  926.,  935.,  933.,  906.,\n        905.,  912.,  972.,  996., 1009.,  961.,  952.,  981.,  917.,\n       1011., 1071., 1920., 3245., 3805., 3926., 3284., 2700., 2347.,\n       2078., 2935., 3040., 1860., 1437., 1512., 1720., 1493., 1026.,\n        928.,  874.,  833.,  850.,   nan])\n\n\nUsing dtype is a good way to control how data are read in.\n\ndat = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'hivSequ.csv'),\n                  sep = ',', header = 0,\n                  dtype = {\n                  'PatientID': int,\n                  'Resp': int,\n                  'PR Seq': str,\n                  'RT Seq': str,\n                  'VL-t0': float,\n                  'CD4-t0': int})\ndat.dtypes\ndat.loc[0,'PR Seq']\n\nPatientID      int64\nResp           int64\nPR Seq        object\nRT Seq        object\nVL-t0        float64\nCD4-t0         int64\ndtype: object\n\n\n'CCTCAAATCACTCTTTGGCAACGACCCCTCGTCCCAATAAGGATAGGGGGGCAACTAAAGGAAGCYCTATTAGATACAGGAGCAGATGATACAGTATTAGAAGACATGGAGTTGCCAGGAAGATGGAAACCAAAAATGATAGGGGGAATTGGAGGTTTTATCAAAGTAARACAGTATGATCAGRTACCCATAGAAATCTATGGACATAAAGCTGTAGGTACAGTATTAATAGGACCTACACCTGTCAACATAATTGGAAGAAATCTGTTGACTCAGCTTGGTTGCACTTTAAATTTY'\n\n\nNote that you can avoid reading in one or more columns by using the usecols argument. Also, specifying the dtype argument explicitly should make for faster file reading.\nIf possible, it’s a good idea to look through the input file in the shell or in an editor before reading into Python to catch such issues in advance. Using the UNIX command less on RTADataSub.csv would have revealed these various issues, but note that RTADataSub.csv is a 1000-line subset of a much larger file of data available from the kaggle.com website. So more sophisticated use of UNIX utilities (as we will see in Unit 3) is often useful before trying to read something into a program.\nIf the file is not nicely arranged by field (e.g., if it has ragged lines), we’ll need to do some more work. We can read each line as a separate string, after which we can process the lines using text manipulation. Here’s an example from some US meteorological data where I know from metadata (not provided here) that the 4-11th values are an identifier, the 17-20th are the year, the 22-23rd the month, etc.\n\nfile_path = os.path.join('..', 'data', 'precip.txt')\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n     lines = file.readlines()\n\nid = [line[3:11] for line in lines]\nyear = [int(line[17:21]) for line in lines]\nmonth = [int(line[21:23]) for line in lines]\nnvalues = [int(line[27:30]) for line in lines]\nyear[0:5]\n\n[2010, 2010, 2010, 2010, 2010]\n\n\nActually, that file, precip.txt, is in a fixed-width format (i.e., every element in a given column has the exact same number of characters),so reading in using pandas.read_fwf() would be a good strategy.",

This can include reading in text from the output of running a shell command and from unzipping a file on the fly.\nHere are some examples of connections:\n\nimport gzip\nwith gzip.open('dat.csv.gz', 'r') as file:\n     lines = file.readlines()\n\nimport zipfile\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('dat.zip', 'r') as archive:\n     with archive.open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n          lines = file.readlines()\n\nimport subprocess\ncommand = \"ls -al\"\noutput = subprocess.check_output(command, shell = True)\n# `output` is a sequence of bytes.\nwith io.BytesIO(output) as stream:  # Create a file-like object.\n    content = stream.readlines()\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.item\", sep=\"\\t\")\n\nIf a file is large, we may want to read it in in chunks (of lines), do some computations to reduce the size of things, and iterate. This is referred to as online processing, streaming, or chunking, and can be done using Pandas (among other tools).\n\nfile_path = os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv')\nchunksize = 50 # Obviously this would be much larger in any real application.\n\nwith pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize = chunksize) as reader:\n     for chunk in reader:\n         # manipulate the lines and store the key stuff\n         print(f'Read {len(chunk)} rows.')\n\nMore details on sequential (on-line) processing of large files can be found in the tutorial on large datasets mentioned in the reference list above.\nOne cool trick that can come in handy is to ‘read’ from a string as if it were a text file.

    "text": "Reading HTML\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for displaying content in a web browser. In simple webpages (ignoring the more complicated pages that involve Javascript), what you see in your browser is simply a rendering (by the browser) of a text file containing HTML.\nHowever, instead of rendering the HTML in a browser, we might want to use code to extract information from the HTML.\nLet’s see a brief example of reading in HTML tables.\nNote that before doing any coding, it can be helpful to look at the raw HTML source code for a given page. We can explore the underlying HTML source in advance of writing our code by looking at the page source directly in the browser (e.g., in Firefox under the 3-lines (hamburger) “open menu” symbol, see Web Developer (or More Tools) -&gt; Page Source and in Chrome View -&gt; Developer -&gt; View Source), or by downloading the webpage and looking at it in an editor, although in some cases (such as the nytimes.com case), what we might see is a lot of JavaScript.\nOne lesson here is not to write a lot of your own code to do something that someone else has probably already written a package for.

Then one can search by HTML tag or attribute for information you want using find_all.\nAs another example, it’s often useful to be able to extract the hyperlinks in an HTML document.\n\nURL = \"http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\nsoup = bs(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n## Approach 1: search for HTML 'a' tags.\na_elements = soup.find_all('a')\nlinks1 = [x.get('href') for x in a_elements]\n## Approach 2: search for 'a' elements with 'href' attribute\nhref_elements = soup.find_all('a', href = True)\nlinks2 = [x.get('href') for x in href_elements]\n## In either case, then use `get` to retrieve the `href` attribute value.\n\nlinks2[0:9]\n# help(bs.find_all)\n\n['?C=N;O=D',\n '?C=M;O=A',\n '?C=S;O=A',\n '?C=D;O=A',\n '/pub/data/ghcn/daily/',\n '1750.csv.gz',\n '1763.csv.gz',\n '1764.csv.gz',\n '1765.csv.gz']\n\n\nThe kwargs keyword arguments to find and find_all allow one to search for elements with particular characteristics, such as having a particular attribute (seen above) or having an attribute have a particular value (e.g., picking out an element with a particular id).\nHere’s another example of extracting specific components of information from a webpage (results not shown, since headlines will vary from day to day). We’ll use get_text to retrieve the element’s value.\n\nURL = \"https://dailycal.org\"\nresponse_news = requests.get(URL)\nsoup_news = bs(response_news.content, 'html.parser')\nh2_elements = soup_news.find_all(\"h2\")\nheadlines2 = [x.get_text() for x in h2_elements]\nh3_elements = soup_news.find_all(\"h3\")\nheadlines3 = [x.get_text() for x in h3_elements]\n\nMore generally, we may want to read an HTML document, parse it into its components (i.e., the HTML elements), and navigate through the tree structure of the HTML.\nWe can use CSS selectors with the select method for more powerful extraction capabilities. Going back to the climate data, let’s extract all the th elements nested within tr elements:\n\nsoup.select(\"tr th\")\n\n[&lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=N;O=D\"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=M;O=A\"&gt;Last modified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=S;O=A\"&gt;Size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=D;O=A\"&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th colspan=\"4\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th colspan=\"4\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/th&gt;]\n\n\nOr we could extract the a elements whose parents are th elements:\n\nsoup.select(\"th &gt; a\")\n\n[&lt;a href=\"?C=N;O=D\"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=M;O=A\"&gt;Last modified&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=S;O=A\"&gt;Size&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=D;O=A\"&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;]\n\n\nNext let’s use the XPath language to specify elements rather than CSS selectors. XPath can also be used for navigating through XML documents.\n\nimport lxml.html\n\n# Convert the BeautifulSoup object to a lxml object\nlxml_doc = lxml.html.fromstring(str(soup))\n\n# Use XPath to select elements\na_elements = lxml_doc.xpath('//a[@href]')\nlinks = [x.get('href') for x in a_elements]\nlinks[0:9]\n\n['?C=N;O=D',\n '?C=M;O=A',\n '?C=S;O=A',\n '?C=D;O=A',\n '/pub/data/ghcn/daily/',\n '1750.csv.gz',\n '1763.csv.gz',\n '1764.csv.gz',\n '1765.csv.gz']",

    "text": "XML, JSON, and YAML\nXML, JSON, and YAML are three common file formats for storing data. All of them allow for key-value pairs and arrays/lists of unnamed elements and for hierarchical structure.\nTo read them into Python (or other languages), we want to use a package that understands the file format and can read the data into appropriate Python data structures. Usually one ends up with a set of nested (because of the hierarchical structure) lists and dictionaries.\n\nXML\nXML is a markup language used to store data in self-describing (no metadata needed) format, often with a hierarchical structure. It consists of sets of elements (also known as nodes because they generally occur in a hierarchical structure and therefore have parents, children, etc.) with tags that identify/name the elements, with some similarity to HTML. Some examples of the use of XML include serving as the underlying format for Microsoft Office and Google Docs documents and for the KML language used for spatial information in Google Earth.\nHere’s a brief example. The book with id attribute bk101 is an element; the author of the book is also an element that is a child element of the book. The id attribute allows us to uniquely identify the element.\n    &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n    &lt;catalog&gt;\n       &lt;book id=\"bk101\"&gt;\n          &lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;\n          &lt;title&gt;XML Developer's Guide&lt;/title&gt;\n          &lt;genre&gt;Computer&lt;/genre&gt;\n          &lt;price&gt;44.95&lt;/price&gt;\n          &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-10-01&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n          &lt;description&gt;An in-depth look at creating applications with XML.&lt;/description&gt;\n       &lt;/book&gt;\n       &lt;book id=\"bk102\"&gt;\n          &lt;author&gt;Ralls, Kim&lt;/author&gt;\n          &lt;title&gt;Midnight Rain&lt;/title&gt;\n          &lt;genre&gt;Fantasy&lt;/genre&gt;\n          &lt;price&gt;5.95&lt;/price&gt;\n          &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-12-16&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n         &lt;description&gt;A former architect battles corporate zombies, an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen of the world.&lt;/description&gt;\n       &lt;/book&gt;\n    &lt;/catalog&gt;\nWe can read XML documents into Python using various packages, including lxml and then manipulate the resulting structured data object. Here’s an example of working with lending data from the Kiva lending non-profit. You can see the XML format in a browser at http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.xml.\nXML documents have a tree structure with information at nodes. As above with HTML, one can use the XPath language for navigating the tree and finding and extracting information from the node(s) of interest.\nHere is some example code for extracting loan info from the Kiva data. We’ll first show the ‘brute force’ approach of working with the data as a list and then the better approach of using XPath.\n\nimport xmltodict\n\nURL = \"https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.xml\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\ndata = xmltodict.parse(response.content)\ndata.keys()\ndata['response'].keys()\ndata['response']['loans'].keys()\nlen(data['response']['loans']['loan'])\ndata['response']['loans']['loan'][2]\ndata['response']['loans']['loan'][2]['activity']\n\ndict_keys(['response'])\n\n\ndict_keys(['paging', 'loans'])\n\n\ndict_keys(['@type', 'loan'])\n\n\n20\n\n\n{'id': '2841918',\n 'name': 'Azanlessossi Kossi',\n 'description': {'languages': {'@type': 'list', 'language': ['fr', 'en']}},\n 'status': 'fundraising',\n 'funded_amount': '0',\n 'basket_amount': '0',\n 'image': {'id': '5653560', 'template_id': '1'},\n 'activity': 'Cereals',\n 'sector': 'Food',\n 'use': 'to buy 20 sacks of corn.',\n 'location': {'country_code': 'TG',\n  'country': 'Togo',\n  'town': 'Kégué',\n  'geo': {'level': 'town', 'pairs': '6.202204 1.239713', 'type': 'point'}},\n 'partner_id': '296',\n 'posted_date': '2024-09-03T15:43:12Z',\n 'planned_expiration_date': '2024-10-08T15:43:12Z',\n 'loan_amount': '850',\n 'borrower_count': '1',\n 'lender_count': '0',\n 'bonus_credit_eligibility': '1',\n 'tags': {'@type': 'list',\n  'tag': [{'name': '#Vegan', 'id': '10'}, {'name': '#Parent', 'id': '16'}]}}\n\n\n'Cereals'\n\n\n\nfrom lxml import etree\ndoc = etree.fromstring(response.content)\n\nloans = doc.xpath(\"//loan\")\n[loan.xpath(\"activity/text()\") for loan in loans]\n\n## suppose we only want the country locations of the loans (using XPath)\n[loan.xpath(\"location/country/text()\") for loan in loans]\n## or extract the geographic coordinates\n[loan.xpath(\"location/geo/pairs/text()\") for loan in loans]\n\n[['Beauty Salon'],\n ['Fish Selling'],\n ['Cereals'],\n ['Construction'],\n ['Food'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Fishing'],\n ['Retail'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Food Market'],\n ['Agriculture'],\n ['Food Market'],\n ['Personal Housing Expenses'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Clothing Sales'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Farming']]\n\n\n[['Brazil'],\n ['Togo'],\n ['Togo'],\n ['El Salvador'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Nicaragua'],\n ['El Salvador'],\n ['Nicaragua'],\n ['Nicaragua'],\n ['Nicaragua'],\n ['Guatemala'],\n ['El Salvador'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Guatemala'],\n ['Sierra Leone'],\n ['Nicaragua'],\n ['Kenya'],\n ['Sierra Leone'],\n ['Kenya'],\n ['Kenya']]\n\n\n[['-23.55052 -46.633309'],\n ['6.202204 1.239713'],\n ['6.202204 1.239713'],\n ['13.332346 -87.850064'],\n ['6.272723 -10.746428'],\n ['13.088391 -85.9994'],\n ['13.332346 -87.850064'],\n ['13.166667 -86.333333'],\n ['12.435556 -86.879444'],\n ['12.435556 -86.879444'],\n ['14.683333 -91.016667'],\n ['13.332346 -87.850064'],\n ['6.272723 -10.746428'],\n ['15.405833 -91.146111'],\n ['8.634544 -12.264173'],\n ['12.435556 -86.879444'],\n ['-0.785561 35.33914'],\n ['8.634544 -12.264173'],\n ['0.3 34.933333'],\n ['-0.583333 35.183333']]\n\n\n\n\nJSON\nJSON files are structured as “attribute-value” pairs (aka “key-value” pairs), often with a hierarchical structure. Here’s a brief example:\n    {\n      \"firstName\": \"John\",\n      \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n      \"isAlive\": true,\n      \"age\": 25,\n      \"address\": {\n        \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n        \"city\": \"New York\",\n        \"state\": \"NY\",\n        \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n      },\n      \"phoneNumbers\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"home\",\n          \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"office\",\n          \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"children\": [],\n      \"spouse\": null\n    }\nA set of key-value pairs is a named array and is placed inside braces (squiggly brackets). Note the nestedness of arrays within arrays (e.g., address within the overarching person array and the use of square brackets for unnamed arrays (i.e., vectors of information), as well as the use of different types: character strings, numbers, null, and (not shown) boolean/logical values. JSON and XML can be used in similar ways, but JSON is less verbose than XML.\nWe can read JSON into Python using the json package. Let’s play again with the Kiva data. The same data that we had worked with in XML format is also available in JSON format: https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.json.\n\nURL = \"https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.json\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\n\nimport json\ndata = json.loads(response.text)\ntype(data)\ndata.keys()\n\ntype(data['loans'])\ndata['loans'][0].keys()\n\ndata['loans'][0]['location']['country']\n[loan['location']['country']  for loan in data['loans']]\n\ndict\n\n\ndict_keys(['paging', 'loans'])\n\n\nlist\n\n\ndict_keys(['id', 'name', 'description', 'status', 'funded_amount', 'basket_amount', 'image', 'activity', 'sector', 'use', 'location', 'partner_id', 'posted_date', 'planned_expiration_date', 'loan_amount', 'borrower_count', 'lender_count', 'bonus_credit_eligibility', 'tags'])\n\n\n'Brazil'\n\n\n['Brazil',\n 'Togo',\n 'Togo',\n 'El Salvador',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Nicaragua',\n 'El Salvador',\n 'Nicaragua',\n 'Nicaragua',\n 'Nicaragua',\n 'Guatemala',\n 'El Salvador',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Guatemala',\n 'Sierra Leone',\n 'Nicaragua',\n 'Kenya',\n 'Sierra Leone',\n 'Kenya',\n 'Kenya']\n\n\nOne disadvantage of JSON is that it is not set up to deal with missing values, infinity, etc.\n\n\nYAML\nYAML is a similar format commonly used for configuration files that control how code/software/tools behave.\nHere’s an example of the YAML file specifying a GitHub Actions workflow.\nNote the use of indentation (similar to Python) for nesting/hierarchy and the lack of quotation with the strings. This makes it lightweight and readable. Also note the use of arrays/lists and sets of key-value pairs.\n\nimport yaml\n\nwith open(\"book.yml\") as stream:\n   config = yaml.safe_load(stream)  ## `safe_load` avoids running embedded code.\n\nprint(config)\n## How many steps in the `deploy-book` job?\nlen(config['jobs']['deploy-book']['steps'])\n\n{'name': 'deploy-book', True: {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}, 'jobs': {'deploy-book': {'runs-on': 'ubuntu-latest', 'steps': [{'uses': 'actions/checkout@v2'}, {'name': 'Set up Python 3.9', 'uses': 'actions/setup-python@v1', 'with': {'python-version': 3.9}}, {'name': 'Install dependencies', 'run': 'pip install -r book-requirements.txt\\n'}, {'name': 'Build the book', 'run': 'jupyter-book build .\\n'}, {'name': 'GitHub Pages action', 'uses': 'peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3', 'with': {'github_token': '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}', 'publish_dir': './_build/html'}}]}}}\n\n\n5\n\n\nNote that (unfortunately) on is treated as a boolean, as discussed in this GitHub issue for the PyYAML package.",

    "text": "Webscraping and web APIs\nHere we’ll see some examples of making requests over the Web to get data. We’ll use APIs to systematically query a website for information. Ideally, but not always, the API will be documented. In many cases that simply amounts to making an HTTP GET request, which is done by constructing a URL.\nThe requests package is useful for a wide variety of such functionality. Note that much of the functionality I describe below is also possible within the shell using either wget or curl.\n\nWebscraping ethics and best practices\nWebscraping is the process of extracting data from the web, either directly from a website or using a web API (application programming interface).\n\nShould you webscrape? In general, if we can avoid webscraping (particularly if there is not an API) and instead directly download a data file from a website, that is greatly preferred.\nMay you webscrape? Before you set up any automated downloading of materials/data from the web you should make sure that what you are about to do is consistent with the rules provided by the website.\n\nSome places to look for information on what the website allows are:\n\nlegal pages such as Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions on the website.\ncheck the robots.txt file (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/robots.txt) to see what a web crawler is allowed to do, and whether the site requires a particular delay between requests to the sites\npotentially contact the site owner if you plan to scrape a large amount of data\n\nHere are some links with useful information:\n\nBlog post on webscraping ethics\nSome information on how to understand a robots.txt file\n\nTips for when you make automated requests:\n\nWhen debugging code that processes the result of such a request, just run the request once, save (i.e., cache) the result, and then work on the processing code applied to the result. Don’t make the same request over and over again.\nIn many cases you will want to include a time delay between your automated requests to a site, including if you are not actually crawling a site but just want to automate a small number of queries.\n\n\n\nWhat is HTTP?\nHTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is a system for communicating information from a server (i.e., the website of interest) to a client (e.g., your laptop). The client sends a request and the server sends a response.\nWhen you go to a website in a browser, your browser makes an HTTP GET request to the website. Similarly, when we did some downloading of html from webpages above, we used an HTTP GET request.\nAnytime the URL you enter includes parameter information after a question mark (www.somewebsite.com?param1=arg1&param2=arg2), you are using an API.\nThe response to an HTTP request will include a status code, which can be interpreted based on this information.\nThe response will generally contain content in the form of text (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON) or raw bytes.\n\n\nAPIs: REST- and SOAP-based web services\nIdeally a web service documents their API (Applications Programming Interface) that serves data or allows other interactions. REST and SOAP are popular API standards/styles. Both REST and SOAP use HTTP requests; we’ll focus on REST as it is more common and simpler. When using REST, we access resources, which might be a Facebook account or a database of stock quotes. The API will (hopefully) document what information it expects from the user and will return the result in a standard format (often a particular file format rather than producing a webpage).\nOften the format of the request is a URL (aka an endpoint) plus a query string, passed as a GET request. Let’s search for plumbers near Berkeley, and we’ll see the GET request, in the form:\nhttps://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=plumbers&find_loc=Berkeley+CA&ns=1\n\nthe query string begins with ?\nthere are one or more Parameter=Argument pairs\npairs are separated by &\n+ is used in place of each space\n\nLet’s see an example of accessing economic data from the World Bank, using the documentation for their API. Following the API call structure, we can download (for example), data on various countries. The documentation indicates that our REST-based query can use either a URL structure or an argument-based structure.\n\n## Queries based on the documentation\napi_url = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/incomeLevel/LIC/country\"\napi_args = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=LIC\"\n\n## Generalizing a bit\nurl = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\ndata = json.loads(response.content)\n\n## Be careful of data truncation/pagination\nif False:\n    url = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json&per_page=1000\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = json.loads(response.content)\n\n## Programmatic control\nbaseURL = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country\"\ngroup = 'MIC'\nformat = 'json'\nargs = {'incomeLevel': group, 'format': format, 'per_page': 1000}\nurl = baseURL + '?' + '&'.join(['='.join(\n                               [key, str(args[key])]) for key in args])\nresponse = requests.get(url)\ndata = json.loads(response.content)\n   \ntype(data)\nlen(data[1])\ntype(data[1][5])\ndata[1][5]\n\nlist\n\n\n105\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{'id': 'BEN',\n 'iso2Code': 'BJ',\n 'name': 'Benin',\n 'region': {'id': 'SSF', 'iso2code': 'ZG', 'value': 'Sub-Saharan Africa '},\n 'adminregion': {'id': 'SSA',\n  'iso2code': 'ZF',\n  'value': 'Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding high income)'},\n 'incomeLevel': {'id': 'LMC',\n  'iso2code': 'XN',\n  'value': 'Lower middle income'},\n 'lendingType': {'id': 'IDX', 'iso2code': 'XI', 'value': 'IDA'},\n 'capitalCity': 'Porto-Novo',\n 'longitude': '2.6323',\n 'latitude': '6.4779'}\n\n\nAPIs can change and disappear. A few years ago, the example above involved the World Bank’s Climate Data API, which I can no longer find!\nAs another example, here we can see the US Treasury Department API, which allows us to construct queries for federal financial data.\nThe Nolan and Temple Lang book provides a number of examples of different ways of authenticating with web services that control access to the service.\nFinally, some web services allow us to pass information to the service in addition to just getting data or information. E.g., you can programmatically interact with your Facebook, Dropbox, and Google Drive accounts using REST based on HTTP POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Authentication is of course important in these contexts and some times you would first authenticate with your login and password and receive a “token”. This token would then be used in subsequent interactions in the same session.\nI created your github.berkeley.edu accounts from Python by interacting with the GitHub API using requests.\n\n\nHTTP requests by deconstructing an (undocumented) API\nIn some cases an API may not be documented or we might be lazy and not use the documentation. Instead we might deconstruct the queries a browser makes and then mimic that behavior, in some cases having to parse HTML output to get at data. Note that if the webpage changes even a little bit, our carefully constructed query syntax may fail.\nLet’s look at some UN data (agricultural crop data). By going to\nhttps://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx?d=FAO, and clicking on “Crops”, we’ll see a bunch of agricultural products with “View data” links. Click on “apricots” as an example and you’ll see a “Download” button that allows you to download a CSV of the data. Let’s select a range of years and then try to download “by hand”. Sometimes we can right-click on the link that will download the data and directly see the URL that is being accessed and then one can deconstruct it so that you can create URLs programmatically to download the data you want.\nIn this case, we can’t see the full URL that is being used because there’s some Javascript involved. Therefore, rather than looking at the URL associated with a link we need to view the actual HTTP request sent by our browser to the server. We can do this using features of the browser (e.g., in Firefox see Web Developer -&gt; Network and in Chrome View -&gt; Developer -&gt; Developer tools and choose the Network tab) (or right-click on the webpage and select Inspect and then Network). Based on this we can see that an HTTP GET request is being used with a URL such as:\nhttp://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc.\nWe’e now able to easily download the data using that URL, which we can fairly easily construct using string processing in bash, Python, or R, such as this (here I just paste it together directly, but using more structured syntax such as I used for the World Bank example would be better):\nHere what is returned is a zip file, which is represented in Python as a sequence of “raw” bytes, so the example code also has some syntax for handling the unzipping and extraction of the CSV file with the data.\n\nimport zipfile\n\n## example URL:\n## https://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;\n##year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&\n##s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\nitemCode = 526\nbaseURL = \"https://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx\"\nyrs = ','.join([str(yr) for yr in range(2012,2018)])\nfilter = f\"?DataFilter=itemCode:{itemCode};year:{yrs}\"\nargs1 = \"&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,3,4,5,6,7&\"\nargs2 = \"s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"\nurl = baseURL + filter + args1 + args2\n## If the website provided a CSV, this would be easier, but it zips the file.\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nwith io.BytesIO(response.content) as stream:  # create a file-like object\n     with zipfile.ZipFile(stream, 'r') as archive:   # treat the object as a zip file\n          with archive.open(archive.filelist[0].filename, 'r') as file:  # get a pointer to the embedded file\n              dat = pd.read_csv(file)\n\ndat.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry or Area\nElement Code\nElement\nYear\nUnit\nValue\nValue Footnotes\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2017.0\nIndex\n202.19\nNaN\n\n\n1\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2016.0\nIndex\n27.45\nNaN\n\n\n2\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2015.0\nIndex\n134.50\nNaN\n\n\n3\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2014.0\nIndex\n138.05\nNaN\n\n\n4\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2013.0\nIndex\n138.05\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what have we achieved?\n\nWe have a reproducible workflow we can share with others (perhaps ourself in the future).\nWe can automate the process of downloading many such files.\n\n\n\nMore details on HTTP requests\nA more sophisticated way to do the download is to pass the request in a structured way with named input parameters. This request is easier to construct programmatically.\n\ndata = {\"DataFilter\": f\"itemCode:{itemCode};year:{yrs}\",\n       \"DataMartID\": \"FAO\", \n       \"Format\": \"csv\", \n       \"c\": \"2,3,4,5,6,7\",\n       \"s\": \"countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"\n       }    \n\nresponse = requests.get(baseURL, params = data)\n\nwith io.BytesIO(response.content) as stream:  \n     with zipfile.ZipFile(stream, 'r') as archive:\n          with archive.open(archive.filelist[0].filename, 'r') as file:  \n              dat = pd.read_csv(file)\n\nIn some cases we may need to send a lot of information as part of the URL in a GET request. If it gets to be too long (e.g,, more than 2048 characters) many web servers will reject the request. Instead we may need to use an HTTP POST request (POST requests are often used for submitting web forms). A typical request would have syntax like this search (using requests):\n\nurl = 'http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/advanced/dumper'\n\ndata = {      \"specipes\":\"briggsae\",\n              \"list\": \"\",\n              \"flank3\": \"0\",\n              \"flank5\": \"0\",\n              \"feature\": \"Gene Models\",\n              \"dump\": \"Plain TEXT\",\n              \"orientation\": \"Relative to feature\",\n              \"relative\": \"Chromsome\",\n              \"DNA\":\"flanking sequences only\",\n              \".cgifields\" :  \"feature, orientation, DNA, dump, relative\"\n}                                  \n\nresponse = requests.post(url, data = data)\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(\"POST request successful\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"POST request failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\nUnfortunately that specific search doesn’t work because the server URL and/or API seem to have changed. But it gives you an idea of what the format would look like.\nrequests can handle other kinds of HTTP requests such as PUT and DELETE. Finally, some websites use cookies to keep track of users, and you may need to download a cookie in the first interaction with the HTTP server and then send that cookie with later interactions. More details are available in the Nolan and Temple Lang book.\n\n\nPackaged access to an API\nFor popular websites/data sources, a developer may have packaged up the API calls in a user-friendly fashion as functions for use from Python, R, or other software. For example there are Python (twitter) and R (twitteR) packages for interfacing with Twitter via its API. (Actually, with the change to X, I don’t know if this API is still available.)\nHere’s some example code for Python. This looks up the US senators’ Twitter names and then downloads a portion of each of their timelines, i.e., the time series of their tweets. Note that Twitter has limits on how much one can download at once.\n\nimport json\nimport twitter\n\n# You will need to set the following variables with your\n# personal information.  To do this you will need to create\n# a personal account on Twitter (if you don't already have\n# one).  Once you've created an account, create a new\n# application here:\n#    https://dev.twitter.com/apps\n#\n# You can manage your applications here:\n#    https://apps.twitter.com/\n#\n# Select your application and then under the section labeled\n# \"Key and Access Tokens\", you will find the information needed\n# below.  Keep this information private.\nCONSUMER_KEY       = \"\"\nCONSUMER_SECRET    = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN        = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = \"\"\n\nauth = twitter.oauth.OAuth(OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET,\n                           CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)\napi = twitter.Twitter(auth=auth)\n\n# get the list of senators\nsenators = api.lists.members(owner_screen_name=\"gov\",\n                             slug=\"us-senate\", count=100)\n\n# get all the senators' timelines\nnames = [d[\"screen_name\"] for d in senators[\"users\"]]\ntimelines = [api.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=name, count = 500) \n             for name in names]\n\n# save information out to JSON\nwith open(\"senators-list.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(senators, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\nwith open(\"timelines.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(timelines, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\n\n\n\nAccessing dynamic pages\nMany websites dynamically change in reaction to the user behavior. In these cases you need a tool that can mimic the behavior of a human interacting with a site. Some options are:\n\nselenium is a popular tool for doing this, and there is a Python package of the same name.\nUsing scrapy plus splash is another approach.",

    "text": "Other kinds of data structures\nYou may have heard of various other kinds of data structures, such as linked lists, trees, graphs, queues, and stacks. One of the key aspects that differentiate such data structures is how one navigates through the elements.\nSets are collections of elements that don’t have any duplicates (like a mathematical set).\nWith a linked list, with each element (or node) has a value and a pointer (reference) to the location of the next element. (With a doubly-linked list, there is also a pointer back to the previous element.) One big advantage of this is that one can insert an element by simply modifying the pointers involved at the site of the insertion, without copying any of the other elements in the list. A big disadvantage is that to get to an element you have to navigate through the list.\n\n\n\nLinked list (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nBoth trees and graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) and links (edges). A tree involves a set of nodes and links to child nodes (also possibly containing information linking the child nodes to their parent nodes). With a graph, the links might not be directional, and there can be cycles.\n\n\n\nTree (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nA stack is a collection of elements that behave like a stack of lunch trays. You can only access the top element directly(“last in, first out”), so the operations are that you can push a new element onto the stack or pop the top element off the stack. In fact, nested function calls behave as stacks, and the memory used in the process of evaluating the function calls is called the ‘stack’.\nA queue is like the line at a grocery store, behaving as “first in, first out”.\nOne can use such data structures either directly or via add-on packages in Python and R, though I don’t think they’re all that commonly used in R. This is probably because statistical/data science/machine learning workflows often involve either ‘rectangular’ data (i.e., dataframe-style data) and/or mathematical computations with arrays. That said, trees and graphs are widely used.\nSome related concepts that we’ll discuss further in Unit 5 include:\n\ntypes: this refers to how a given piece of information is stored and what operations can be done with the information.\n\n‘primitive’ types are the most basic types that often relate directly to how data are stored in memory or on disk (e.g., booleans, integers, numeric (real-valued), character, pointer (address, reference).\n\npointers: references to other locations (addresses) in memory. One often uses pointers to avoid unnecessary copying of data.\nhashes: hashing involves fast lookup of the value associated with a key (a label), using a hash function, which allows one to convert the key to an address. This avoids having to find the value associated with a specific key by looking through all the keys until the key of interest is found (an O(n) operation).",

Python usually makes use of the double type (8 bytes) in C for the underlying representation of real-valued numbers in C variables, so what we’ll really be seeing is how such types behave in C on most modern machines. It’s actually a bit more complicated in that one can use real-valued numbers that use something other than 8 bytes in numpy by specifying a dtype.\nThe handling of integers is even more complicated. In numpy, the default is 8 byte integers, but other integer dtypes are available. And in Python itself, integers can be arbitrarily large.",

    "section": "Representing real numbers",
    "text": "Representing real numbers\n\nInitial exploration\nReals (also called floating points) are stored on the computer as an approximation, albeit a very precise approximation. As an example, if we represent the distance from the earth to the sun using a double, the error is around a millimeter. However, we need to be very careful if we’re trying to do a calculation that produces a very small (or very large number) and particularly when we want to see if numbers are equal to each other.\nIf you run the code here, the results may surprise you.\n\n0.3 - 0.2 == 0.1\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1 # Hmmm...\n\nnp.float64(0.3) - np.float64(0.2) == np.float64(0.1)\n\n0.75 - 0.5 == 0.25\n0.6 - 0.4 == 0.2\n## any ideas what is different about those two comparisons?\n\nNext, let’s consider the number of digits of accuracy we have for a variety of numbers. We’ll use format within a handy wrapper function, dg, defined earlier, to view as many digits as we want:\n\na = 0.3\nb = 0.2\ndg(a)\n\n0.29999999999999998890\n\ndg(b)\n\n0.20000000000000001110\n\ndg(a-b)\n\n0.09999999999999997780\n\ndg(0.1)\n\n0.10000000000000000555\n\ndg(1/3)\n\n0.33333333333333331483\n\n\nSo empirically, it looks like we’re accurate up to the 16th decimal place\nBut actually, the key is the number of digits, not decimal places.\n\ndg(1234.1234)\n\n1234.12339999999994688551\n\ndg(1234.123412341234)\n\n1234.12341234123391586763\n\n\nNotice that we can represent the result accurately only up to 16 significant digits. This suggests no need to show more than 16 significant digits and no need to print out any more when writing to a file (except that if the number is bigger than \\(10^{16}\\) then we need extra digits to correctly show the magnitude of the number if not using scientific notation). And of course, often we don’t need anywhere near that many.\nLet’s return to our comparison, 0.75-0.5 == 0.25.\n\ndg(0.75)\n\n0.75000000000000000000\n\ndg(0.50)\n\n0.50000000000000000000\n\n\nWhat’s different about the numbers 0.75 and 0.5 compared to 0.3, 0.2, 0.1?\n\n\nMachine epsilon\nMachine epsilon is the term used for indicating the (relative) accuracy of real numbers and it is defined as the smallest float, \\(x\\), such that \\(1+x\\ne1\\):\n\n1e-16 + 1.0\n\n1.0\n\nnp.array(1e-16) + np.array(1.0)\n\n1.0\n\n1e-15 + 1.0\n\n1.000000000000001\n\nnp.array(1e-15) + np.array(1.0)\n\n1.000000000000001\n\n2e-16 + 1.0\n\n1.0000000000000002\n\nnp.finfo(np.float64).eps\n\n2.220446049250313e-16\n\ndg(2e-16 + 1.0)\n\n1.00000000000000022204\n\n\nWhat about in single precision, e.g. on a GPU?\n\nnp.finfo(np.float32).eps\n\n1.1920929e-07\n\n\n\n\nFloating point representation\nFloating point refers to the decimal point (or radix point since we’ll be working with base 2 and decimal relates to 10).\nTo proceed further we need to consider scientific notation, such as in writing Avogadro’s number as \\(+6.023\\times10^{23}\\). As a baseline for what is about to follow note that we can express a decimal number in the following expansion \\[6.037=6\\times10^{0}+0\\times10^{-1}+3\\times10^{-2}+7\\times10^{-3}\\] A real number on a computer is stored in what is basically scientific notation: \\[\\pm d_{0}.d_{1}d_{2}\\ldots d_{p}\\times b^{e}\\label{eq:floatRep}\\] where \\(b\\) is the base, \\(e\\) is an integer and \\(d_{i}\\in\\{0,\\ldots,b-1\\}\\). \\(e\\) is called the exponent and \\(d=d_{1}d_{2}\\ldots d_{p}\\) is called the mantissa.\nLet’s consider the choices that the computer pioneers needed to make in using this system to represent numbers on a computer using base 2 (\\(b=2\\)). First, we need to choose the number of bits to represent \\(e\\) so that we can represent sufficiently large and small numbers. Second we need to choose the number of bits, \\(p\\), to allocate to \\(d=d_{1}d_{2}\\ldots d_{p}\\), which determines the accuracy of any computer representation of a real.\nThe great thing about floating points is that we can represent numbers that range from incredibly small to very large while maintaining good precision. The floating point floats to adjust to the size of the number. Suppose we had only three digits to use and were in base 10. In floating point notation we can express \\(0.12\\times0.12=0.0144\\) as \\((1.20\\times10^{-1})\\times(1.20\\times10^{-1})=1.44\\times10^{-2}\\), but if we had fixed the decimal point, we’d have \\(0.120\\times0.120=0.014\\) and we’d have lost a digit of accuracy. (Furthermore, we wouldn’t be able to represent numbers bigger than \\(0.99\\).)\nMore specifically, the actual storage of a number on a computer these days is generally as a double in the form: \\[(-1)^{S}\\times1.d\\times2^{e-1023}=(-1)^{S}\\times1.d_{1}d_{2}\\ldots d_{52}\\times2^{e-1023}\\] where the computer uses base 2, \\(b=2\\), (so \\(d_{i}\\in\\{0,1\\}\\)) because base-2 arithmetic is faster than base-10 arithmetic. The leading 1 normalizes the number; i.e., ensures there is a unique representation for a given computer number. This avoids representing any number in multiple ways, e.g., either \\(1=1.0\\times2^{0}=0.1\\times2^{1}=0.01\\times2^{2}\\). For a double, we have 8 bytes=64 bits. Consider our representation as (\\(S,d,e\\)) where \\(S\\) is the sign. The leading 1 is the hidden bit and doesn’t need to be stored because it is always present. In general \\(e\\) is represented using 11 bits (\\(2^{11}=2048\\)), and the subtraction takes the place of having a sign bit for the exponent. (Note that in our discussion we’ll just think of \\(e\\) in terms of its base 10 representation, although it is of course represented in base 2.) This leaves \\(p=52 = 64-1-11\\) bits for \\(d\\).\nIn this code I force storage as a double by tacking on a decimal place, .0.\n\nbits(2.0**(-1)) # 1/2\n\n'0011111111100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2.0**0)  # 1\n\n'0011111111110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2.0**1)  # 2\n\n'0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2.0**1 + 2.0**0)  # 3\n\n'0100000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2.0**2)  # 4\n\n'0100000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(-2)\n\n'1100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\n\nLet’s see that we can manually work out the bit-wise representation of 5.25 and it matches what we came up with before in class:\n\nbits(5.25)\n\n'0100000000010101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\n\nSo that is \\(1.0101 \\times 2^{1025-1023} = 1\\times 2^{2} + 0\\times 2^{1} + 1\\times 2^{0} + 0\\times 2^{-1} + 1\\times 2^{-2}\\), where the 2nd through 12th bits are \\(10000000001\\), which codes for \\(1\\times 2^{10}+2^{0}=1025\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nGiven a fixed number of bits for a number, what is the tradeoff between using bits for the \\(d\\) part vs. bits for the \\(e\\) part?\n\n\nLet’s consider what can be represented exactly:\n\ndg(.1)\n\n0.10000000000000000555\n\ndg(.5)\n\n0.50000000000000000000\n\ndg(.25)\n\n0.25000000000000000000\n\ndg(.26)\n\n0.26000000000000000888\n\ndg(1/32)\n\n0.03125000000000000000\n\ndg(1/33)\n\n0.03030303030303030387\n\n\nSo why is 0.5 stored exactly and 0.1 not stored exactly?

    "text": "Precision\nConsider our representation as (S, d, e) where we have \\(p=52\\) bits for \\(d\\). Since we have \\(2^{52}\\approx0.5\\times10^{16}\\), we can represent about that many discrete values, which means we can accurately represent about 16 digits (in base 10). The result is that floats on a computer are actually discrete (we have a finite number of bits), and if we get a number that is in one of the gaps (there are uncountably many reals), it’s approximated by the nearest discrete value. The accuracy of our representation is to within 1/2 of the gap between the two discrete values bracketing the true number. Let’s consider the implications for accuracy in working with large and small numbers. By changing \\(e\\) we can change the magnitude of a number. So regardless of whether we have a very large or small number, we have about 16 digits of accuracy, since the absolute spacing depends on what value is represented by the least significant digit (the ulp, or unit in the last place) in \\(d\\), i.e., the \\(p=52\\)nd one, or in terms of base 10, the 16th digit.

Machine epsilon tells us also about the relative spacing of numbers.\nFirst let’s consider numbers of magnitude one. The next biggest number we can represent after \\(1=1.00...00\\times2^{0}\\) is \\(1.000...01\\times2^{0}\\). The difference between those two numbers (i.e., the spacing) is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon & = &0.00...01 \\times 2^{0} \\\\\n& =& 0 \\times 2^{0} + 0 \\times 2^{-1} + \\cdots + 0\\times 2^{-51} + 1\\times2^{-52}\\\\\n& =& 1\\times2^{-52}\\\\\n& \\approx & 2.2\\times10^{-16}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMachine epsilon gives the absolute spacing for numbers near 1 and the relative spacing for numbers with a different order of magnitude and therefore a different absolute magnitude of the error in representing a real. The relative spacing at \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{(1+\\epsilon)x-x}{x}=\\epsilon\\] since the next largest number from \\(x\\) is given by \\((1+\\epsilon)x\\).\nSuppose \\(x=1\\times10^{6}\\). Then the absolute error in representing a number of this magnitude is \\(x\\epsilon\\approx2\\times10^{-10}\\). (Actually the error would be one-half of the spacing, but that’s a minor distinction.) We can see by looking at the numbers in decimal form, where we are accurate to the order \\(10^{-10}\\) but not \\(10^{-11}\\). This is equivalent to our discussion that we have only 16 digits of accuracy.\n\ndg(1000000.1)\n\n1000000.09999999997671693563\n\n\nLet’s see what arithmetic we can do exactly with integer-valued numbers stored as doubles and how that relates to the absolute spacing of numbers we’ve just seen:\n\n2.0**52\n\n4503599627370496.0\n\n2.0**52+1\n\n4503599627370497.0\n\n2.0**53\n\n9007199254740992.0\n\n2.0**53+1\n\n9007199254740992.0\n\n2.0**53+2\n\n9007199254740994.0\n\ndg(2.0**54)\n\n18014398509481984.00000000000000000000\n\ndg(2.0**54+2)\n\n18014398509481984.00000000000000000000\n\ndg(2.0**54+4)\n\n18014398509481988.00000000000000000000\n\nbits(2**53)\n\n'0100001101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2**53+1)\n\n'0100001101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2**53+2)\n\n'0100001101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\n\nbits(2**54)\n\n'0100001101010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2**54+2)\n\n'0100001101010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n\nbits(2**54+4)\n\n'0100001101010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\n\n\nThe absolute spacing is \\(x\\epsilon\\), so we have spacings of \\(2^{52}\\times2^{-52}=1\\), \\(2^{53}\\times2^{-52}=2\\), \\(2^{54}\\times2^{-52}=4\\) for numbers of magnitude \\(2^{52}\\), \\(2^{53}\\), and \\(2^{54}\\), respectively.\nWith a bit more work (e.g., using Mathematica), one can demonstrate that doubles in Python in general are represented as the nearest number that can stored with the 64-bit structure we have discussed and that the spacing is as we have discussed.

Ideally, we would have accuracy to 36 places (16 digits + the 20 zeroes), but we’ve lost 8 digits to catastrophic cancellation.\nIt’s best to do any subtraction on numbers that are not too large. For example, if we compute the sum of squares in a naive way, we can lose all of the information in the calculation because the information is in digits that are not computed or stored accurately: \\[s^{2}=\\sum x_{i}^{2}-n\\bar{x}^{2}\\]\n\n## No problem here:\nx = np.array([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0])\nn = len(x)\nnp.sum(x**2)-n*np.mean(x)**2 \n\n2.0\n\nnp.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)\n\n2.0\n\n## Adding/subtracting a constant shouldn't change the result:\nx = x + 1e8\nnp.sum(x**2)-n*np.mean(x)**2  ## YIKES!\n\n0.0\n\nnp.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)\n\n2.0\n\n\nA good principle to take away is to subtract off a number similar in magnitude to the values (in this case \\(\\bar{x}\\) is obviously ideal) and adjust your calculation accordingly. In general, you can sometimes rearrange your calculation to avoid catastrophic cancellation. Another example involves the quadratic formula for finding a root (p. 101 of Gentle).\nAdding or subtracting numbers that are very different in magnitude. The precision will be that of the large magnitude number, since we can only represent that number to a certain absolute accuracy, which is much less than the absolute accuracy of the smaller number:\n\ndg(123456781234.2)\n\n123456781234.19999694824218750000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.1)        # truth: 123456781234.1\n\n123456781234.09999084472656250000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.01)       # truth: 123456781234.19\n\n123456781234.19000244140625000000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.001)      # truth: 123456781234.199\n\n123456781234.19898986816406250000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.0001)     # truth: 123456781234.1999\n\n123456781234.19989013671875000000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.00001)    # truth: 123456781234.19999\n\n123456781234.19998168945312500000\n\ndg(123456781234.2 - 0.000001)   # truth: 123456781234.199999\n\n123456781234.19999694824218750000\n\n123456781234.2 - 0.000001 == 123456781234.2\n\nTrue\n\n\nThe larger number in the calculations above is of magnitude \\(10^{11}\\), so the absolute error in representing the larger number is around \\(1\\times10^{^{-5}}\\). Thus in the calculations above we can only expect the answers to be accurate to about \\(1\\times10^{-5}\\). In the last calculation above, the smaller number is smaller than \\(1\\times10^{-5}\\) and so doing the subtraction has had no effect. This is analogous to trying to do \\(1+1\\times10^{-16}\\) and seeing that the result is still 1.\nA work-around when we are adding numbers of very different magnitudes is to add a set of numbers in increasing order. However, if the numbers are all of similar magnitude, then by the time you add ones later in the summation, the partial sum will be much larger than the new term. A (second) work-around to that problem is to add the numbers in a tree-like fashion, so that each addition involves a summation of numbers of similar size.\n\nGiven the limited range of computer numbers, be careful when you are:\n\nMultiplying or dividing many numbers, particularly large or small ones. Never take the product of many large or small numbers as this can cause over- or under-flow. Rather compute on the log scale and only at the end of your computations should you exponentiate. E.g., \\[\\prod_{i}x_{i}/\\prod_{j}y_{j}=\\exp(\\sum_{i}\\log x_{i}-\\sum_{j}\\log y_{j})\\]\n\nLet’s consider some challenges that illustrate that last concern.\n\nChallenge: consider multiclass logistic regression, where you have quantities like this: \\[p_{j}=\\text{Prob}(y=j)=\\frac{\\exp(x\\beta_{j})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\exp(x\\beta_{k})}=\\frac{\\exp(z_{j})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\exp(z_{k})}\\] for \\(z_{k}=x\\beta_{k}\\). What will happen if the \\(z\\) values are very large in magnitude (either positive or negative)? How can we reexpress the equation so as to be able to do the calculation? Hint: think about multiplying by \\(\\frac{c}{c}\\) for a carefully chosen \\(c\\).\nSecond challenge: The same issue arises in the following calculation. Suppose I want to calculate a predictive density (e.g., in a model comparison in a Bayesian context): \\[\\begin{aligned}\nf(y^{*}|y,x) & = & \\int f(y^{*}|y,x,\\theta)\\pi(\\theta|y,x)d\\theta\\\\\n& \\approx & \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(y_{i}^{*}|x,\\theta_{j})\\\\\n& = & \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\log f(y_{i}^{*}|x,\\theta_{j})\\\\\n& \\equiv & \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(v_{j})\\end{aligned}\\] First, why do I use the log conditional predictive density? Second, let’s work with an estimate of the unconditional predictive density on the log scale, \\(\\log f(y^{*}|y,x)\\approx\\log\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(v_{j})\\). Now note that \\(e^{v_{j}}\\) may be quite small as \\(v_{j}\\) is the sum of log likelihoods. So what happens if we have terms something like \\(e^{-1000}\\)? So we can’t exponentiate each individual \\(v_{j}\\). This is what is known as the “log sum of exponentials” problem (and the solution as the “log-sum-exp trick”). Thoughts?\n\nNumerical issues come up frequently in linear algebra. For example, they come up in working with positive definite and semi-positive-definite matrices, such as covariance matrices. You can easily get negative numerical eigenvalues even if all the eigenvalues are positive or non-negative. Here’s an example where we use an squared exponential correlation as a function of time (or distance in 1-d), which is mathematically positive definite (i.e., all the eigenvalues are positive) but not numerically positive definite:\n\nxs = np.arange(100)\ndists = np.abs(xs[:, np.newaxis] - xs)\ncorr_matrix = np.exp(-(dists/10)**2)     # This is a p.d. matrix (mathematically).\nscipy.linalg.eigvals(corr_matrix)[80:99]  # But not numerically!\n\narray([-2.10937946e-16+9.49526594e-17j, -2.10937946e-16-9.49526594e-17j,\n       -1.77590164e-16+1.30160558e-16j, -1.77590164e-16-1.30160558e-16j,\n       -2.09305049e-16+0.00000000e+00j,  2.23869166e-16+3.21640840e-17j,\n        2.23869166e-16-3.21640840e-17j,  1.98271873e-16+9.08175827e-17j,\n        1.98271873e-16-9.08175827e-17j, -1.49116518e-16+0.00000000e+00j,\n       -1.23773149e-16+6.06467275e-17j, -1.23773149e-16-6.06467275e-17j,\n       -2.48071368e-18+1.51188749e-16j, -2.48071368e-18-1.51188749e-16j,\n       -4.08131705e-17+6.79669911e-17j, -4.08131705e-17-6.79669911e-17j,\n        1.27901871e-16+2.34695655e-17j,  1.27901871e-16-2.34695655e-17j,\n        5.23476667e-17+4.08642121e-17j])",

Even if you develop your documents using Quarto, Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, etc. rather than LaTeX-based documents, LaTeX math syntax is the common tool for writing math syntax that will render beautifully.\nOptional Lab 0 software/command line help session: (August 30 in lab room) Help session for installing software, accessing a UNIX-style command line, and basic command line usage (e.g., the UNIX basics tutorial). You can show up at any time (unlike all remaining labs). You should have software installed, be able to accesss the command line, and have started to become familiar with basic command line usage before class on Friday September 6.\nLab 1: (September 6) First section/lab on using Git, setting up your GitHub repository for problem sets, and using Quarto to generate dynamic documents. Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission.\nBash shell tutorial and exercises: (by September 9) Read through this tutorial on using the bash shell. You can skip the pages on Regular Expressions and Managing Processes. Work through the first 10 problems in the exercises and submit your answers via Gradescope. This is not a formal problem set, so you don’t need to worry about formatting nor about explaining/commenting your answers, nor do you need to put your answers in your GitHub class repository. In fact it’s even fine with me if you hand-write the answers and scan them to an electronic document. I just want to make sure you’ve worked through the tutorial. I’ll be doing demonstrations on using the bash shell in class starting on September 6, so that will be helpful as you work through the tutorial.\nRegular expression reading and exercises: (by September 13), read the regular expression material in the tutorial on using the bash shell. Then answer the regular expressions (regex) practice problems and submit your answers on Gradescope. This is not one of the graded problem sets but rather an assignment that will simply be noted as being completed or not.",

    "text": "Embarrassingly parallel (EP) problems\nAn EP problem is one that can be solved by doing independent computations in separate processes without communication between the processes. You can get the answer by doing separate tasks and then collecting the results. Examples in statistics include\n\nsimulations with many independent replicates\nbootstrapping\nstratified analyses\nrandom forests\ncross-validation.\n\nThe standard setup is that we have the same code running on different datasets. (Note that different processes may need different random number streams, as we will discuss in the Simulation Unit.)\nTo do parallel processing in this context, you need to have control of multiple processes. Note that on a shared system with queueing/scheduling software set up, this will generally mean requesting access to a certain number of processors and then running your job in such a way that you use multiple processors.\nIn general, except for some modest overhead, an EP problem can ideally be solved with \\(1/p\\) the amount of time for the non-parallel implementation, given \\(p\\) CPUs. This gives us a speedup of \\(p\\), which is called linear speedup (basically anytime the speedup is of the form \\(kp\\) for some constant \\(k\\)).",

    "text": "Computer architecture\nComputers now come with multiple processors for doing computation. Basically, physical constraints have made it harder to keep increasing the speed of individual processors, so the chip industry is now putting multiple processing units in a given computer and trying/hoping to rely on implementing computations in a way that takes advantage of the multiple processors.\nEveryday personal computers usually have more than one processor (more than one chip) and on a given processor, often have more than one core (multi-core). A multi-core processor has multiple processors on a single computer chip. On personal computers, all the processors and cores share the same memory.\nSupercomputers and computer clusters generally have tens, hundreds, or thousands of ‘nodes’, linked by a fast local network. Each node is essentially a computer with its own processor(s) and memory. Memory is local to each node (distributed memory). One basic principle is that communication between a processor and its memory is much faster than communication between processors with different memory. An example of a modern supercomputer is the Perlmutter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, which has 3072 CPU-only nodes and 1792 nodes with GPUs, and a total of about 500,000 CPU cores. Each node has 512 GB of memory for a total of 2.3 PB of memory.\nFor our purposes, there is little practical distinction between multi-processor and multi-core situations. The main issue is whether processes share memory or not. In general, I won’t distinguish between cores and processors. We’ll just focus on the number of cores on given personal computer or a given node in a cluster.",

    "section": "Distributed vs. shared memory",
    "text": "Distributed vs. shared memory\nThere are two basic flavors of parallel processing (leaving aside GPUs): distributed memory and shared memory. With shared memory, multiple processors (which I’ll call cores for the rest of this document) share the same memory. With distributed memory, you have multiple nodes, each with their own memory. You can think of each node as a separate computer connected by a fast network.\n\nShared memory\nFor shared memory parallelism, each core is accessing the same memory so there is no need to pass information (in the form of messages) between different machines. However, unless one is using threading (or in some cases when one has processes created by forking), objects will still be copied when creating new processes to do the work in parallel. With threaded computations, multiple threads can access object(s) without making explicit copies. But in some programming contexts one needs to be careful that the threads on different cores doesn’t mistakenly overwrite places in memory that are used by other cores (this is generally not an issue in Python or R).\nWe’ll cover two types of shared memory parallelism approaches in this unit:\n\nthreaded linear algebra\nmulticore functionality\n\n\nThreading\nThreads are multiple paths of execution within a single process. If you are monitoring CPU usage (such as with top in Linux or Mac) and watching a job that is executing threaded code, you’ll see the process using more than 100% of CPU. When this occurs, the process is using multiple cores, although it appears as a single process rather than as multiple processes.\nNote that this is a different notion than a processor that is hyperthreaded. With hyperthreading a single core appears as two cores to the operating system.\n\n\n\nDistributed memory\nParallel programming for distributed memory parallelism requires passing messages between the different nodes. The standard protocol for doing this is MPI, of which there are various versions, including openMPI.\nWhile there are various Python and R that use MPI behind the scenes, we’ll only cover distributed memory parallelization via Dask, which doesn’t use MPI.",

    "text": "GPUs\nGPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are processing units originally designed for rendering graphics on a computer quickly. This is done by having a large number of simple processing units for massively parallel calculation. The idea of general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing is to exploit this capability for general computation.\nMost researchers don’t program for a GPU directly but rather use software (often machine learning software such as Tensorflow or PyTorch, or other software that automatically uses the GPU such as JAX) that has been programmed to take advantage of a GPU if one is available. The computations that run on the GPU are run in GPU kernels, which are functions that are launched on the GPU. The overall workflow runs on the CPU and then particular (usually computationally-intensive tasks for which parallelization is helpful) tasks are handed off to the GPU. GPUs and similar devices (e.g., TPUs) are often called “co-processors” in recognition of this style of workflow.\nThe memory on a GPU is distinct from main memory on the computer, so when writing code that will use the GPU, one generally wants to avoid having large amounts of data needing to be transferred back and forth between main (CPU) memory and GPU memory. Also, since there is overhead in launching a GPU kernel, one wants to avoid launching a lot of kernels relative to the amount of work being done by each kernel.",

The basic idea is that they rent out their servers on a pay-as-you-go basis. You get access to a virtual machine that can run various versions of Linux or Microsoft Windows server and where you choose the number of processing cores you want. You configure the virtual machine with the applications, libraries, and data you need and then treat the virtual machine as if it were a physical machine that you log into as usual. You can also assemble multiple virtual machines into your own virtual cluster and use platforms such as databases and Spark on the cloud provider’s virtual machines.",

    "text": "Scenario 1: one model fit\nSpecific scenario: You need to fit a single statistical/machine learning model, such as a random forest or regression model, to your data.\nGeneral scenario: Parallelizing a single task.\n\nScenario 1A:\nA given method may have been written to use parallelization and you simply need to figure out how to invoke the method for it to use multiple cores.\nFor example the documentation for the RandomForestClassifier in scikit-learn’s ensemble module indicates it can use multiple cores – note the n_jobs argument (not shown here because the help info is very long).\n\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nhelp(sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou’ll usually need to look for an argument with one of the words threads, processes, cores, cpus, jobs, etc. in the argument name.\n\n\n\n\nScenario 1B: Parallelized linear algebra\nIf a method does linear algebra computations on large matrices/vectors, Python (and R) can call out to parallelized linear algebra packages (the BLAS and LAPACK).\nThe BLAS is the library of basic linear algebra operations (written in Fortran or C). A fast BLAS can greatly speed up linear algebra in R relative to the default BLAS that comes with R. Some fast BLAS libraries are\n\nIntel’s MKL; available for educational use for free\nOpenBLAS; open source and free\nApple’s Accelerate framework BLAS (vecLib) for Macs; provided with your Mac\n\nIn addition to being fast when used on a single core, all of these BLAS libraries are threaded - if your computer has multiple cores and there are free resources, your linear algebra will use multiple cores, provided your program is linked against the threaded BLAS installed on your machine and provided the shell environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS is not set to one. (Macs make use of VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS rather than OMP_NUM_THREADS and if MKL is being used, then one needs MKL_NUM_THREADS)\nFor parallel (threaded) linear algebra in Python, one can use an optimized BLAS with the numpy and (therefore) scipy packages, on Linux or using the Mac’s vecLib BLAS. Details will depend on how you install Python, numpy, and scipy. More details on figuring out what BLAS is being used and how to install a fast threaded BLAS on your own computer are here.\nDask and some other packages also provide threading, but pure Python code is not threaded.\nHere’s some code that illustrates the speed of using a threaded BLAS:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = (6000, 6000))\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nx = np.dot(x.T, x) \nU = np.linalg.cholesky(x)\nelapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\nprint(\"Elapsed Time (8 threads):\", elapsed_time)\n\nWe’d need to restart Python after setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1 in order to compare the time when run in parallel vs. on a single core. That’s hard to demonstrate in this generated document, but when I ran it, it took 6.6 seconds, compared to 3 seconds using 8 cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that for smaller linear algebra problems, we may not see any speed-up or even that the threaded calculation might be slower because of overhead in setting up the parallelization and because the parallelized linear algebra calculation involves more actual operations than when done serially.\n\n\n\n\nScenario 1C: GPUs and linear algebra\nLinear algebra with large matrices is often a very good use case for GPUs. So if you or someone implementing a method can run the linear algebra you need on a GPU, that can give a big speedup.\nHere’s an example of using the GPU to multiply large matrices using PyTorch. We could do this similarly with Tensorflow or JAX. I’ve just inserted the timing from running this on an SCF machine with a powerful GPU.\nPackages such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX can run linear algebra calculations in parallel on either the CPU or GPU (depending on whether a GPU is available on the computer the code is being run on).\nUnder the hood, there are different implementations (sometimes called kernels) of a given computation For example, there would be both parallelized CPU and GPU implementations of matrix multiplication.\n\nimport torch\n\nstart = torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True)\nend = torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True)\n\ngpu = torch.device(\"cuda:0\")\n\nn = 10000\nx = torch.randn(n,n, device = gpu)\ny = torch.randn(n,n, device = gpu)\n\n## Time the matrix multiplication on GPU:\nstart.record()\nz = torch.matmul(x, y)\nend.record()\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()\nprint(start.elapsed_time(end))   # 120 ms.\n\n## Compare to CPU:\ncpu = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n\nx = torch.randn(n,n, device = cpu)\ny = torch.randn(n,n, device = cpu)\n\n## Time the matrix multiplication on CPU:\nstart.record()\nz = torch.matmul(x, y)\nend.record()\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()\nprint(start.elapsed_time(end))   # 18 sec.\n\nThe GPU calculation takes 100-200 milliseconds (ms), while the CPU calculation took 18 seconds using two CPU cores. That’s a speed-up of more than 100x!\nFor a careful comparison between GPU and CPU, we’d want to consider the effect of using 4-byte floating point numbers for the GPU calculation.\nWe’d also want to think about how many CPU cores should be used for the comparison.\n\n\nScenario 1D: Parallelized vectorized calculations\nSimilarly, packages such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX can parallelize vectorized calculations on either the CPU or GPU.\nRecall that in Unit 5, we used JAX to run a vectorized calculation on a very large 1-d array. JAX automatically ran that in parallel across multiple (CPU) cores.\nHere we’ll see that if we have GPU available, JAX will automatically run the calculation in parallel on the GPU. I’ll do this separately on a machine with a GPU and paste the results in here.\n\nimport time\nimport jax\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef myfun_jnp(x):\n    y = jnp.exp(x) + 3 * jnp.sin(x)\n    return y\n\nn = 500000000\n\nkey = jax.random.key(1)\nx_jax = jax.random.normal(key, (n,))  # 32-bit by default\nprint(x_jax.platform())\n\nt0 = time.time()\nz_jax1 = myfun_jnp(x_jax).block_until_ready()\nt_gpu = round(time.time() - t0, 3)\n\ncpu_device = jax.devices('cpu')[0]\nwith jax.default_device(cpu_device):\n    key = jax.random.key(1)\n    x_jax = jax.random.normal(key, (n,))  # 32-bit by default\n    print(x_jax.platform())\n    t0 = time.time()\n    z_jax2 = myfun_jnp(x_jax).block_until_ready()\n    t_cpu = round(time.time() - t0, 3)\n\nprint(f\"GPU time: {t_gpu}\\nCPU time: {t_cpu}\")\n\nGPU time: 0.015\nCPU time: 4.709\nSo the GPU is much faster, even though the JAX CPU implementation uses multiple threads (as can be seen with top).\nForcing JAX to use the CPU when a GPU is available is a bit of a hassle. When I tried to use jax.config.update('jax_platform_name', 'cpu'), it didn’t seem to work for some reason.",

Also note that dask.compute executes synchronously, which means the main process waits until the dask.compute call is complete before allowing other commands to be run. This synchronous evaluation is also called a blocking call because execution of the task in the worker processes blocks the main process. In contrast, if control returns to the user before the worker processes are done, that would be asynchronous evaluation (aka, a non-blocking call).\nNote: the use of chunksize = 1 forces Dask to immediately start one task on each worker. Without that argument, by default it groups tasks so as to reduce the overhead of starting each task individually, but when we have few tasks, that prevents effective parallelization. We’ll discuss this in much more detail in Scenario 4.\nLazy evaluation is a concept that works well with computational graphs where the start of one piece of a computation can’t start until another piece ends. For example, when we use dask.delayed, Dask will first figure out the computational graph underlying a set of function calls and then execute them in the order needed. This makes use of lazy evaluation.",

    "text": "Scenario 4: parallelizing over prediction methods\nScenario: parallelizing over prediction methods or other cases where execution time varies.\nIf you need to parallelize over prediction methods or in other contexts in which the computation time for the different tasks varies widely, you want to avoid having the parallelization group the tasks into batches in advance, because some cores may finish a lot more quickly than others. Starting the tasks one by one (not in batches) is called dynamic allocation.\nIn contrast, if the computation time is about the same for the different tasks and you have a large number of tasks (in which case the effect of averaging may also help with load-balancing) then you want to group the tasks into batches. This is called static allocation or prescheduling. This avoids the extra overhead (~1 millisecond per task) of scheduling many tasks.\n\nDynamic allocation\nWith Dask’s distributed scheduler, Dask starts up each delayed evaluation separately (i.e., dynamic allocation).\nWe’ll set up an artificial example with four slow tasks and 12 fast tasks and see the speed of running with the default of dynamic allocation under Dask’s distributed scheduler. Then in the next section, we’ll compare to the worst-case scenario with all four slow tasks in a single batch.\n\nimport scipy.special\n\nn_cores = 4\nfrom dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster\ncluster = LocalCluster(n_workers = n_cores)\n\n/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/distributed/node.py:182: UserWarning: Port 8787 is already in use.\nPerhaps you already have a cluster running?\nHosting the HTTP server on port 44299 instead\n  warnings.warn(\n\nc = Client(cluster)\n\n## 4 slow tasks and 12 fast ones.\nn = np.repeat([10**7, 10**5, 10**5, 10**5], 4)\n\ndef fun(i):\n    print(f\"Working on {i}.\")\n    return np.mean(scipy.special.gammaln(np.exp(np.random.normal(size = n[i]))))\n    \n\nt0 = time.time()\nout = fun(1)\n\nWorking on 1.\n\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.5711870193481445\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout = fun(5)\n\nWorking on 5.\n\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.013278484344482422\n\nt0 = time.time()\ntasks = c.map(fun, range(len(n)))\nresults = c.gather(tasks)  \nprint(time.time() - t0)  # 0.8 sec. \n\n1.069821834564209\n\n\ncluster.close()\n\nNote that with relatively few tasks per core here, we could have gotten unlucky if the tasks were in a random order and multiple slow tasks happen to be done by a single worker.\n\n\nStatic allocation\nNext, note that by default the ‘processes’ scheduler sets up tasks in batches, with a default chunksize of 6.

And even with a distributed map() it doesn’t appear possible to ask that the tasks be broken up into batches. Therefore if you want static allocation, you could use the processes scheduler if using a single machine, or if you need to use the distributed schduler you could break up the tasks into batches manually.\nWith the processes scheduler, static allocation is the default, with a default chunksize of 6 tasks per batch. You can force dynamic allocation by setting chunksize = 1.\n(Note that in R, static allocation is the default when using the future package.)",

So the data needs to be sent to each process (or task) individually and then stored as distinct objects in memory.\nHere when we use the processes scheduler, we make copies. Whether there is a copy per task or a copy per process seems to depend on exactly what the parallelized code is doing (perhaps based on whether there is random number generation in the code).\n\nimport os\n\ndef do_analysis(i,x):\n    '''\n    A fake \"analysis\", identical for each task.\n    '''\n    # Check number of processes and copies.\n    print(f\"Object id: {id(x)}, process id: {os.getpid()}\")\n    return np.mean(x)\n\nn_cores = 4\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5*10**7)   # our big \"dataset\"\n\ndask.config.set(scheduler='processes', num_workers = n_cores, chunksize = 1)\n\n&lt;dask.config.set object at 0x7f62901374a0&gt;\n\n\ntasks = []\np = 8\nfor i in range(p):\n    tasks.append(dask.delayed(do_analysis)(i,x))\n\nt0 = time.time()\nresults = dask.compute(tasks)\nt_elapsed = time.time() - t0\n\nObject id: 140528840440112, process id: 1148556\nObject id: 140619687115056, process id: 1148559\nObject id: 140509694916912, process id: 1148561\nObject id: 140539164195120, process id: 1148560\nObject id: 140528840440112, process id: 1148556\nObject id: 140619687115056, process id: 1148559\nObject id: 140509694916912, process id: 1148561\nObject id: 140539164195120, process id: 1148560\n\nprint(t_elapsed)\n\n6.530309677124023\n\n\nA much better approach here would be to use the threads scheduler, in which case all workers can access the same data objects with no copying (but of course we cannot modify the data in that case without potentially causing problems for the other tasks). Without the copying, this is really fast.\n\ndask.config.set(scheduler='threads', num_workers = n_cores)\n\n&lt;dask.config.set object at 0x7f626d78da60&gt;\n\ntasks = []\np = 8\nfor i in range(p):\n    tasks.append(dask.delayed(do_analysis)(i,x))\n\nt0 = time.time()\nresults = dask.compute(tasks)\n\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\nObject id: 140060718814320, process id: 1179893\n\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.1076960563659668\n\n\nWe can also consider using the the distributed scheduler (which is fine to use on a single machine or multiple machines). In order to have one copy per worker instead of one copy per task, we can apply delayed() to the global data object.\nHowever, with the Dask distributed scheduler, it is complicated to assess what is going on, because the scheduler seems to try to optimize assignment of tasks to workers in a way that may cause an imbalance in the number of tasks assigned to each worker. In this example, all the tasks are assigned to a single worker.\n(If instead the do_analysis function ran this: np.mean(x + np.random.normal(size=5*10**7)), we’d see the tasks be done on more than one worker.)\n\nfrom dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster\ncluster = LocalCluster(n_workers = n_cores)\n\n/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/distributed/node.py:182: UserWarning: Port 8787 is already in use.\nPerhaps you already have a cluster running?\nHosting the HTTP server on port 37909 instead\n  warnings.warn(\n\nc = Client(cluster)\n\nx = dask.delayed(x)  # To have one copy per worker.\n\ntasks = []\np = 8\nfor i in range(p):\n    tasks.append(dask.delayed(do_analysis)(i,x))\n\nt0 = time.time()\nresults = dask.compute(tasks)\n\n/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/distributed/client.py:3169: UserWarning: Sending large graph of size 381.47 MiB.\nThis may cause some slowdown.\nConsider scattering data ahead of time and using futures.\n  warnings.warn(\n\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n1.2565109729766846\n\n\ncluster.close()\n\nAlso, Dask gives a warning about sending the data to the workers in advance.

    "text": "Scenario 7: Simulation study with n=1000 replicates: parallel random number generation\nWe’ll probably skip this for now and come back to it when we discuss random number generation in the Simulation Unit.\nThe key thing when thinking about random numbers in a parallel context is that you want to avoid having the same ‘random’ numbers occur on multiple processes. On a computer, random numbers are not actually random but are generated as a sequence of pseudo-random numbers designed to mimic true random numbers. The sequence is finite (but very long) and eventually repeats itself. When one sets a seed, one is choosing a position in that sequence to start from. Subsequent random numbers are based on that subsequence. All random numbers can be generated from one or more random uniform numbers, so we can just think about a sequence of values between 0 and 1.\nSpecific scenario: You are running a simulation study with n=1000 replicates.\nGeneral scenario: Safely handling random number generation in parallel.\nEach replicate involves fitting two statistical/machine learning methods.\nHere, unless you really have access to multiple hundreds of cores, you might as well just parallelize across replicates.\nHowever, you need to think about random number generation. One option is to set the random number seed to different values for each replicate. One danger in setting the seed like that is that the random numbers in the different replicate could overlap somewhat. This is probably somewhat unlikely if you are not generating a huge number of random numbers, but it’s unclear how safe it is.\nWe can use functionality with numpy’s PCG64 or MT19937 generators to be completely safe in our parallel random number generation. Each provide a jumped() function that moves the RNG ahead as if one had generated a very large number of random variables (\\(2^{128}\\)) for the Mersenne Twister and nearly that for the PCG64).\nHere’s how we can set up the use of the PCG64 generator:\n\nbitGen = np.random.PCG64(1)\nrng = np.random.Generator(bitGen)\nrng.random(size = 3)\n\narray([0.51182162, 0.9504637 , 0.14415961])\n\n\nNow let’s see how to jump forward. And then verify that jumping forward two increments is the same as making two separate jumps.\n\nbitGen = np.random.PCG64(1)\nbitGen = bitGen.jumped(1)\nrng = np.random.Generator(bitGen)\nrng.normal(size = 3)\n\narray([ 1.23362391,  0.42793616, -1.90447637])\n\nbitGen = np.random.PCG64(1)\nbitGen = bitGen.jumped(2)\nrng = np.random.Generator(bitGen)\nrng.normal(size = 3)\n\narray([-0.31752967,  1.22269493,  0.28254622])\n\nbitGen = np.random.PCG64(1)\nbitGen = bitGen.jumped(1)\nbitGen = bitGen.jumped(1)\nrng = np.random.Generator(bitGen)\nrng.normal(size = 3)\n\narray([-0.31752967,  1.22269493,  0.28254622])\n\n\nWe can also use jumped() with the Mersenne Twister.\n\nbitGen = np.random.MT19937(1)\nbitGen = bitGen.jumped(1)\nrng = np.random.Generator(bitGen)\nrng.normal(size = 3)\n\narray([ 0.12667829, -2.1031878 , -1.53950735])\n\n\nSo the strategy to parallelize across tasks (or potentially workers if random number generation is done sequentially for tasks done by a single worker) is to give each task the same seed and use jumped(i) where i indexes the tasks (or workers).\n\ndef myrandomfun(i):\n    bitGen = np.random.PCG(1)\n    bitGen = bitGen.jumped(i)\n    # insert code with random number generation\n\nOne caution is that it appears that the period for PCG64 is \\(2^{128}\\) and that jumped(1) jumps forward by nearly that many random numbers. That seems quite strange, and I don’t understand it.\nAlternatively as recommended in the docs:\n\nn_tasks = 10\nsg = np.random.SeedSequence(1)\nrngs = [Generator(PCG64(s)) for s in sg.spawn(n_tasks)]\n## Now pass elements of rng into your function that is being computed in parallel\n\ndef myrandomfun(rng):\n    # insert code with random number generation, such as:\n    z = rng.normal(size = 5)\n\nIn R, the rlecuyer package deals with this. The L’Ecuyer algorithm has a period of \\(2^{191}\\), which it divides into subsequences of length \\(2^{127}\\).",

However, in many cases this can mean repeating computations or re-reading data if you need to do multiple operations on a dataset.\nFor example, if you are creating a Dask distributed dataset from data on disk, I think this means that every distinct set of computations (each computational graph) will involve reading the data from disk again.\nOne implication is that if you can include all computations on a large dataset within a single computational graph (i.e., a call to compute) that may be much more efficient than making separate calls.\nHere’s an example with Dask dataframe on some air traffic delay data, where we make sure to do all our computations as part of one graph:\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler='processes', num_workers = 6)  \nimport dask.dataframe as ddf\nair = ddf.read_csv('/scratch/users/paciorek/243/AirlineData/csvs/*.csv.bz2',\n      compression = 'bz2',\n      encoding = 'latin1',   # (unexpected) latin1 value(s) 2001 file TailNum field\n      dtype = {'Distance': 'float64', 'CRSElapsedTime': 'float64',\n      'TailNum': 'object', 'CancellationCode': 'object'})\n# specify dtypes so Pandas doesn't complain about column type heterogeneity\n\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nair.DepDelay.min().compute()   # about 200 seconds.\nprint(time.time()-t0)\nt0 = time.time()\nair.DepDelay.max().compute()   # about 200 seconds.\nprint(time.time()-t0)\nt0 = time.time()\n(mn, mx) = dask.compute(air.DepDelay.max(), air.DepDelay.min())  # about 200 seconds\nprint(time.time()-t0)",

However, you can also explicitly control the number of threads available to a process.\nFor most threaded code (that based on the openMP protocol), the number of threads can be set by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable (VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS on a Mac). E.g., to set it for four threads in the bash shell:\n\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\n\nDo this before starting your R or Python session or before running your compiled executable.\nAlternatively, you can set OMP_NUM_THREADS as you invoke your job, e.g., here with R:\n\nOMP_NUM_THREADS=4 R CMD BATCH --no-save job.R job.out\n\n\nCautions about speed and threaded BLAS\nIn many cases, using multiple threads for linear algebra operations will outperform using a single thread, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case, in particular for operations with small matrices and vectors. You can compare speeds by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to different values. In cases where threaded linear algebra is slower than unthreaded, you would want to set OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1.\nMore generally, if you are using the parallel tools in Section 4 to simultaneously carry out many independent calculations (tasks), it is likely to be more effective to use the fixed number of cores available on your machine so as to split up the tasks, one per core, without taking advantage of the threaded BLAS (i.e., restricting each process to a single thread).",

It’s basically a flag used to tag a given operation such that when and where that operation is carried out is controlled at a higher level.

The future package allows one to write one’s computational code without hard-coding whether or how parallelization would be done. Instead one writes the code in a generic way and at the beginning of one’s code sets the ‘plan’ for how the parallel computation should be done given the computational resources available. Simply changing the ‘plan’ changes how parallelization is done for any given run of the code.\nMore concisely, the key ideas are:\n\nSeparate what to parallelize from how and where the parallelization is actually carried out.\nDifferent users can run the same code on different computational resources (without touching the actual code that does the computation).",

    "section": "String processing and regular expressions in Python",
    "text": "String processing and regular expressions in Python\nHere we’ll see functionality for working with strings in Python, focusing on regular expressions with the re package. This will augment our consideration of regular expressions in the shell, in particular by seeing how we can replace patterns in addition to finding them.\nThe re package provides Perl-style regular expressions, but it doesn’t seem to support named character classes such as [:digit:]. Instead use classes such as \\d and [0-9].\n\nFinding patterns\nIn Python, you can apply a matching function and then query the result to get information about what was matched and where in the string.\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300.\"\nm = re.search(\"\\\\d+\", text)\nm\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(18, 21), match='919'&gt;\n\nm.group()\n\n'919'\n\nm.start()\n\n18\n\nm.end()\n\n21\n\nm.span()\n\n(18, 21)\n\n\nNotice that that showed us only the first match.\nThe discussion of special characters explains why we need to provide \\\\d rather than \\d.\nWe can instead use findall to get all the matches.\n\nre.findall(\"\\\\d+\", text)\n\n['919', '543', '3300']\n\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\npattern = re.compile(\"\\\\d+\")\nre.findall(pattern, text)\n\n['919', '543', '3300']\n\n\nThe compile can be omitted and will be done implicitly, but is a good idea to do explicitly if you have a complex regex pattern that you will use repeatedly (e.g., on every line in a file). It is also a reminder that regular expressions is a separate language, which can be compiled into a program. The compilation results in an object that relies on finite state machines to match the pattern.\nTo ignore case, do the following:\n\ntext = \"That cat in the Hat\"\nre.findall(\"hat\", text, re.IGNORECASE)\n\n['hat', 'Hat']\n\n\nThere are several other regex flags (also called compilation flags) that can control the behavior of the matching engine in interesting ways (check out re.VERBOSE and re.MULTILINE for instance).\nWe can of course use list comprehension to work with multiple strings. But we need to be careful to check whether a match was found.\n\ndef return_group(pattern, txt):\n    m = re.search(pattern, txt)\n    if m:\n       return m.group()\n    else:\n       return None\n\ntext = [\"Here's my number: 919-543-3300.\", \"hi John, good to meet you\",\n        \"They bought 731 bananas\", \"Please call 1.919.554.3800\"]\n[return_group(\"\\\\d+\", str) for str in text]\n\n['919', None, '731', '1']\n\n\nRecall that we can search for location-specific matches in relation to the start and end of a string.\n\ntext = \"hats are all that are important to a hatter.\"\nre.findall(\"^hat\\\\w+\", text)\n\n['hats']\n\n\nRecall that we can search based on repetitions (as already demonstrated with the \\w+ just above).\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300. They bought 731 hats. Please call 1.919.554.3800.\"\nre.findall(\"\\\\d{3}[-.]\\\\d{3}[-.]\\\\d{4}\", text)\n\n['919-543-3300', '919.554.3800']\n\n\nAs another example, the phone number detection problem could have been done a bit more compactly (as well as more generally to allow for an initial “1-” or “1.”) as:\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300. They bought 731 bananas. Please call 1.919.554.3800.\"\nre.findall(\"((1[-.])?(\\\\d{3}[-.]){1,2}\\\\d{4})\", text)\n\n[('919-543-3300', '', '543-'), ('1.919.554.3800', '1.', '554.')]\n\n\nQuestion: the above regex would actually match something that is not a valid phone number. What can go wrong?\nWhen you are searching for all occurrences of a pattern in a large text object, it may be beneficial to use finditer:\n\nit = re.finditer(\"(http|ftp):\\\\/\\\\/\", text)  # http or ftp followed by ://\n\nfor match in it:\n    match.span()\n\nThis method behaves lazily and returns an iterator that gives us one match at a time, and only scans for the next match when we ask for it. This is similar to the behavior we saw with pandas.read_csv(chunksize = n)\n\n\nManipulating and replacing patterns\nWe can replace matching substrings with re.sub.\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300.\"\nre.sub(\"\\\\d\", \"Z\", text   )\n\n\"Here's my number: ZZZ-ZZZ-ZZZZ.\"\n\n\nNext let’s consider grouping using (). We’ll see that the grouping operator also controls what is returned as the matched patterns.\nHere’s a basic example of using grouping via parentheses with the OR operator.\n\ntext = \"At the site http://www.ibm.com. Some other text. ftp://ibm.com\"\nre.search(\"(http|ftp):\\\\/\\\\/\", text).group()\n\n'http://'\n\n\nHowever, if we want to find all the matches and try to use findall, we see that, when grouping operators are present, it returns only the “captured” groups, as discussed a bit in help(re.findall), so we’d need to add an additional grouping operator to capture the full pattern when using findall:\n\nre.findall(\"(http|ftp):\\\\/\\\\/\", text)  \n\n['http', 'ftp']\n\nre.findall(\"((http|ftp):\\\\/\\\\/)\", text) \n\n[('http://', 'http'), ('ftp://', 'ftp')]\n\n\nGroups are also used when we need to reference back to a detected pattern when doing a replacement. This is why they are sometimes referred to as “capturing groups”. For example, here we’ll find any numbers and add underscores before and after them:\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300. They bought 731 bananas. Please call 919.554.3800.\"\nre.sub(\"([0-9]+)\", \"_\\\\1_\", text)\n\n\"Here's my number: _919_-_543_-_3300_. They bought _731_ bananas. Please call _919_._554_._3800_.\"\n\n\nHere we’ll remove commas not used as field separators.\n\ntext = '\"H4NY07011\",\"ACKERMAN, GARY L.\",\"H\",\"$13,242\",,,'\nre.sub(\"([^\\\",]),\", \"\\\\1\", text)\n\n'\"H4NY07011\",\"ACKERMAN GARY L.\",\"H\",\"$13242\",,,'\n\n\nHow does that work? Consider that [^\\\",] matches a character that is not a quote and not a comma. The regex is such a character followed by a comma, with the matched character saved in \\\\1 because of the grouping operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nInstead of removing the commas to remove the ambiguity, how would you convert the comma delimiters to pipe (|) delimiters (since the pipe is rarely used in text)?\n\n\nExtending the use of \\\\1, we can refer to multiple captured groups:\n\ntext = \"Here's my number: 919-543-3300. They bought 731 bananas.

That example also shows why it is the default. What would happen if it were not the default?\nHowever, sometimes greedy matching doesn’t get us what we want.\nConsider this attempt to remove multiple html tags from a string.\n\ntext = \"Do an internship &lt;b&gt; in place &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; one &lt;/b&gt; course.\"\nre.sub(\"&lt;.*&gt;\", \"\", text)\n\n'Do an internship  course.'\n\n\nNotice what happens because of greedy matching.\nOne way to avoid greedy matching is to use a ? after the repetition specifier.\n\nre.sub(\"&lt;.*?&gt;\", \"\", text)\n\n'Do an internship  in place  of  one  course.'\n\n\nHowever, that syntax is a bit frustrating because ? is also used to indicate 0 or 1 repetitions, making the regex a bit hard to read/understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nSuppose I want to strip out HTML tags but without using the ? to avoid greedy matching. How can I be more careful in constructing my regex?",

    "section": "Special characters in Python",
    "text": "Special characters in Python\nRecall that when characters are used for special purposes, we need to ‘escape’ them if we want them interpreted as the actual (literal) character. In what follows, I show this in Python, but similar manipulations are sometimes needed in the shell and in R.\nThis can get particularly confusing in Python as the backslash is also used to input special characters such as newline (\\n) or tab (\\t). Apparently there was some change in handling escape sequences as of Python 3.12. We now need to do this for the regex \\d:\n\nre.search(\"\\\\d+\", \"a93b\")\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 3), match='93'&gt;\n\n\nIn Python 3.11, it was fine to use \\d, but now we need \\\\d, because Python now tries to interpret \\d as a special character (like \\n, but \\d doesn’t exist) and doesn’t pass it directly along as regex syntax.\nHere are some examples of using special characters.\n\ntmp = \"Harry said, \\\"Hi\\\"\"\nprint(tmp)   # This prints out without a newline -- this is hard to show in rendered doc.\n\nHarry said, \"Hi\"\n\ntmp = \"Harry said, \\\"Hi\\\".\\n\"\nprint(tmp)   # This prints out with the newline -- hard to show in rendered doc.\n\nHarry said, \"Hi\".\n\ntmp = [\"azar\", \"foo\", \"hello\\tthere\\n\"]\nprint(tmp[2])\n\nhello   there\n\nre.search(\"[\\tZ]\", tmp[2])   # Search for a tab or a 'Z'.\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(5, 6), match='\\t'&gt;\n\n\nHere are some examples of using various special characters in regex syntax. To use a special character as a regular character, we need to escape it (which in Python 3.12 involves two backslashes, as discussed above):\n\n## Search for characters that are not 'z'\n## (using ^ as regular expression syntax)\nre.search(\"[^z]\", \"zero\")\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='e'&gt;\n\n## Show results for various input strings:\nfor st in [\"a^2\", \"93\", \"zzz\", \"zit\", \"azar\"]:\n    print(st + \":\\t\", re.search(\"[^z]\", st))\n\na^2:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='a'&gt;\n93:  &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='9'&gt;\nzzz:     None\nzit:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='i'&gt;\nazar:    &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='a'&gt;\n\n    \n\n## Search for either a '^' (as a regular character) or a 'z':\nfor st in [\"a^2\", \"93\", \"zzz\", \"zit\", \"azar\"]:\n    print(st + \":\\t\", re.search(\"[\\\\^z]\", st))\n\na^2:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='^'&gt;\n93:  None\nzzz:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='z'&gt;\nzit:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='z'&gt;\nazar:    &lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='z'&gt;\n\n    \n\n## Search for exactly three characters\n## (using . as regular expression syntax)\nfor st in [\"abc\", \"1234\", \"def\"]:\n    print(st + \":\\t\", re.search(\"^.{3}$\", st))\n\nabc:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='abc'&gt;\n1234:    None\ndef:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='def'&gt;\n\n    \n\n## Search for a period (as a regular character)\nfor st in [\"3.9\", \"27\", \"4.2\"]:\n    print(st + \":\\t\", re.search(\"\\\\.\", st)) \n\n3.9:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='.'&gt;\n27:  None\n4.2:     &lt;re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='.'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nExplain why we use a single backslash to get a newline and double backslash to write out a Windows path in the examples here:\n\n## Suppose we want to use a \\ in our string:\nprint(\"hello\\nagain\")\n\nhello\nagain\n\nprint(\"hello\\\\nagain\")\n\nhello\\nagain\n\nprint(\"My Windows path is: C:\\\\Users\\\\nadal.\")\n\nMy Windows path is: C:\\Users\\nadal.\n\n\nAnother way to achieve this effect if your string does not contain any special characters is to prefix your string literal with an r for “raw”:\n\nprint(r\"My Windows path is: C:\\Users\\nadal.\")\n\nMy Windows path is: C:\\Users\\nadal.\n\n\n\n\nOn a more involved note, searching for an actual backslash gets even more complicated (lookup “backslash plague” or “backslash hell”), because we need to pass two backslashes as the regular expression, so that a literal backslash is searched for. However, to pass two backslashes, we need to escape each of them with a backslash so Python doesn’t treat each backslash as part of a special character. So that’s four backslashes to search for a single backslash! Yikes. One rule of thumb is just to keep entering backslashes until things work!\n\n## Use and search for an actual backslash\ntmp = \"something \\\\ other\\n\"\nprint(tmp) \n\nsomething \\ other\n\nre.search(\"\\\\\\\\\", tmp)\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(10, 11), match='\\\\'&gt;\n\ntry:\n    re.search(\"\\\\\", tmp)\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\nbad escape (end of pattern) at position 0\n\n\nAgain here you can use “raw” strings, at the price of losing the ability to use any special characters:\n\n## Search for an actual backslash\nre.search(r\"\\\\\", tmp)\n\n&lt;re.Match object; span=(10, 11), match='\\\\'&gt;\n\n\nThis tells python to treat this sting literal without any escaping, but that does not apply to the regex engine (or else we would have used a single backslash). So yes. This can be quite confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPasting quotation marks\n\n\n\nBe careful when cutting and pasting from documents that are not text files as you may paste in something that looks like a single or double quote, but which Python cannot interpret as a quote because it’s some other ASCII (or Unicode) quote character. If you paste in a ” from PDF, it will not be interpreted as a standard Python double quote mark.\n\n\nSimilar things come up in the shell and in R, but in the shell you often don’t need as many backslashes. E.g. you could do this to look for a literal backslash character.\n\necho \"hello\" &gt; file.txt\necho \"with a \\ there\" &gt;&gt; file.txt\ngrep '\\\\' file.txt\n\nwith a \\ there",

'RTADataSub.csv', 'test.db', 'airline.csv', 'stackoverflow-2021.db', 'coop.txt.gz', 'co2_annmean_mlo.csv', 'precip.txt', 'airline.parquet', 'precipData.txt', 'hivSequ.csv', 'cpds.csv']\n\n\nIt’s best if you can to write your code, as shown here with os.path.join, in a way that is agnostic to the underlying operating system (i.e., that works regardless of the operating system).\nTo get some info on the system you’re running on:\n\nimport platform\nplatform.system()\n\n'Linux'\n\nos.uname()\n\nposix.uname_result(sysname='Linux', nodename='smeagol', release='5.15.0-107-generic', version='#117-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 26 12:26:49 UTC 2024', machine='x86_64')\n\nplatform.python_version()\n\n'3.12.2'\n\n\nTo retrieve environment variables:\n\nos.environ['PATH']\n\n'/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/bin:/usr/local/linux/miniforge-3.12/condabin:/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/condabin:/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/bin:/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/condabin:/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/bin:/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/bin:/accounts/vis/paciorek/bin:/system/linux/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin:/accounts/vis/paciorek/.local/bin:/accounts/vis/paciorek/.local/bin:/accounts/vis/paciorek/.local/bin:/accounts/vis/paciorek/.local/bin'\n\n\nYou can have an Python script act as a shell script (like running a bash shell script) as follows.\n\nWrite your Python code in a text file, say example.py\nAs the first line of the file, include #!/usr/bin/python (like #!/bin/bash in a bash shell file, as seen in Unit 2) or for more portability across machines, include #!/usr/bin/env python.\nMake the Python code file executable with chmod: chmod ugo+x example.py.\nRun the script from the command line: ./example.py\n\nIf you want to pass arguments into your script, you can do so with the argparse package.\n\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument('-y', '--year', default=2002,\n                    help='year to download')\nparser.add_argument('-m', '--month', default=None,\n                    help='month to download')\nargs = parse.parse_args()\nargs.year\nyear = int(args.year)\n\nNow we can run it as follows in the shell:\n\n./example.py 2004 January\n\nUse Ctrl-C to interrupt execution. This will generally back out gracefully, returning you to a state as if the command had not been started. Note that if Python is exceeding the amount of memory available, there can be a long delay. This can be frustrating, particularly since a primary reason you would want to interrupt is when Python runs out of memory.",

    "text": "The import statement\nThe import statement allows one to get access to code in a module. Importantly it associates the names of the objects in the module with a name accessible in the scope in which it was imported (i.e., the current context). The mapping of names (references) to objects is called a namespace. We discuss scopes and namespaces in more detail later.\n\ndel mymod\ntry:           # Check if `mymod` is in scope.\n    mymod.x\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\nname 'mymod' is not defined\n\ny = 3\n\nimport mymod\nmymod         # This is essentially a dictionary in the current (global) scope.\n\n&lt;module 'mymod' from '/accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units/mymod.py'&gt;\n\nx             # This is not a name in the current (global) scope.\n\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined\n\nrange         # This is a builtin, not from the module.\n\n&lt;class 'range'&gt;\n\nmymod.x\n\n7\n\ndir(mymod)\n\n['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'myfun', 'range', 'x']\n\nmymod.x\n\n7\n\nmymod.range\n\n3\n\n\nSo y and mymod are in the global namespace and range and x are in the module namespace of mymod. You can access the built-in range function from the global namespace but it turns out it’s actually in the built-ins scope (more later).\nNote the usefulness of distinguishing the objects in a module from those in the global namespace. We’ll discuss this more in a bit.\nThat said, we can make an object defined in a module directly accessible in the current scope (adding it to the global namespace in this example) at which point it is distinct from the object in the module:\n\nfrom mymod import x\nx   # now part of global namespace\n\n7\n\ndir()\n\n['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'content', 'files', 'io', 'it', 'm', 'math', 'mymod', 'os', 'pattern', 'platform', 'r', 're', 'return_group', 'st', 'stream', 'subprocess', 'sys', 'text', 'time', 'tmp', 'x', 'y']\n\nmymod.x = 5\nx = 3\nmymod.x\n\n5\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\nBut in general we wouldn’t want to use from to import objects in that fashion because we could introduce name conflicts and we reduce modularity.\nThat said, it can be tedious to always have to type the module name (and in many cases there are multiple submodule names you’d also need to type).\n\nimport mymod as m\nm.x\n\n5",

A package can automatically import the subpackages via the main __init__.py or require the user to import them manually, e.g., import mypkg.mysubpkg.\n\nmkdir mypkg/mysubpkg\n\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; mypkg/mysubpkg/__init__.py\nfrom .values import *\nprint(\"Welcome to my package's subpackage.\")\nEOF\n\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; mypkg/mysubpkg/values.py\nx = 999\nb = 7\nd = 9\nEOF\n\n\nimport mypkg.mysubpkg     ## Note that __init__.py is invoked\n\nWelcome to my package's subpackage.\n\nmypkg.mysubpkg.b\n\n7\n\nmypkg.x\n\n7\n\n\nNote that a given __init__.py is invoked when importing anything nested within the directory containing the __init__.py; in the case above the __init__.py from mypkg is invoked, though for some reason the “Welcome to my package.” output is not showing up in this rendered document.\nIf we wanted to automatically import the subpackage we would add from . import mysubpkg to mypkg/__init__.py, which uses relative imports. The alternative “absolute” import would be import mypkg.mysubpkg, which finds mypkg using sys.path (which specifies a set of paths of where to look).\nOne would generally not import the items from mysubpkg directly into the mypkg namespace but there may be cases one would do something like this. For example numpy.linspace is actually found in numpy/core/function_base.py, but we don’t need to refer to numpy.core.linspace because of how numpy structures the import statements in __init__.py. In contrast, the linear algebra functions are available via the subpackage namespace as numpy.linalg.&lt;function_name&gt;.\nTake a look at dir(numpy), dir(numpy.linalg), and dir(numpy.core) to get a better sense for this in a real package.",

    "section": "Installing packages",
    "text": "Installing packages\nIf a package is on PyPI or available through Conda but not on your system, you can install it easily (usually). You don’t need root permission on a machine to install a package, though you may need to use pip install --user or set up a new Conda environment.\nPackages often depend on other packages. In general, if one package depends on another, pip or conda will generally install the dependency automatically.\nOne advantage of Conda is that it can also install non-Python packages on which a Python package depends, whereas with pip you sometimes need to install a system package to satisfy a dependency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Mamba/libmamba and the Conda-forge channel\n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon to run into a case where conda has trouble installing a package because of version inconsistencies amongst the dependencies. mamba is a drop-in replacement for conda and often does a better job of this “dependency resolution”. We use mamba by default on the SCF. In recent versions of Conda, you can also use the Mamba’s dependency resolver when running conda commands by running conda config --set solver libmamba, which puts solver: libmamba in your .condarc file. It’s also generally recommended to use the conda-forge channel (i.e., location) when installing packages with Conda (this is done automatically when using mamba). conda-forge provides a wide variety of up-to-date packages, maintained by the community.\n\n\n\nMaking your package installable (optional)\nIt’s pretty easy to configure your package so that it can be built and installed via pip. See the structure of this example repository. In fact, one can install the package with only either setup.py or pyproj.toml, but the other files listed here are recommended:\n\npyproj.toml (or pyproject.toml): this is a configuration file used by packaging tools. In the mytoy example it specifies to use setuptools to build and install the package.\nsetup.py: this is run when the package is built and installed when using setuptools. In the example, it simply runs setuptools.setup(). With recent versions of setuptools, you don’t actually need this so long as you have the pyproj.toml file.\nsetup.cfg: provides metadata about the package when using setuptools.\nenvironment.yml: provides information about the full environment in which your package should be used (including examples, documentation, etc.). For projects using setuptools, a minimal list of dependencies needed for installation and use of the package can instead be included in the install_requires option of setup.cfg.\nLICENSE: specifies the license for your package giving the terms under which others can use it.\n\nThe postBuild file is a completely optional file only needed if you want to use the package with a MyBinder environment.\nAt the numpy GitHub repository, by looking in pyproject.toml, you can see that numpy is build and installed using a system called Meson, while at the Jupyter GitHub repository you can see that the jupyter package is built and installed using setuptools.\nBuilding a package usually refers to compiling source code but for a Python package that just has Python code, nothing needs to be compiled. Installing a package means putting the built package into a location on your computer where packages are installed.\nYou can also make your package public on PyPI or through Conda, but that is not something we’ll cover here.\n\n\nReproducibility and package management\nFor reproducibility, it’s important to know the versions of the packages you use (and the version of Python). pip and conda make it easy to do this. You can create a requirements file that captures the packages you are currently using (and, critically, their versions) and then install exactly that set of packages (and versions) based on that requirements file.\n\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\nConda is a general package manager. You can use it to manage Python packages but lots of other software as well, including R and Julia.\nConda environments provide an additional layer of modularity/reproducibility, allowing you to set up a fully reproducible environment for your computation. Here (by explicitly giving python=3.12) the Python 3.12 executable and all packages you install in the environment are fully independent of whatever Python executables are installed on the system.\n\nconda create -n myenv python=3.12\nsource activate myenv\nconda install numpy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you use conda activate rather than source activate, Conda will prompt you to run conda init, which will make changes to your ~/.bashrc that, for one, activate the Conda base environment automatically when a shell is started. This may be fine, but it’s helpful to be aware.\n\n\n\n\nPackage locations\nPackages in Python (and in R, Julia, etc.) may be installed in various places on the filesystem, and it sometimes it is helpful (e.g., if you end up with multiple versions of a package installed on your system) to be able to figure out where on the filesystem the package is being loaded from.\nWe can use the __file__ and __version__ objects in a package to see where on the filesystem a package is installed and what version it is:\n\nimport numpy as np\nnp.__file__\n\n'/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'\n\nnp.__version__\n\n'1.26.4'\n\n\n(pip list or conda list will also show version numbers, for all packages.)\nsys.path shows where Python looks for packages on your system.\n\n\nSource vs. binary packages\nThe difference between a source package and a binary package is that the source package has the raw Python (and C/C++ and Fortran, in some cases) code as text files, while the binary package has all the non-Python code in a binary/non-text format, with the C/C++ and Fortran code already having been compiled.\nIf you install a package from source, C/C++/Fortran code will be compiled on your system (if the package has such code). That should mean the compiled code will work on your system, but requires you to have a compiler available and things properly configured. A binary package doesn’t need to be compiled on your system, but in some cases the code may not run on your system because it was compiled in such a way that is not compatible with your system.\nPython wheels are a binary package format for Python packages. Wheels for some packages will vary by platform (i.e., operating system) so that the package will install correctly on the system where it is being installed.",

    "text": "Types and classes\n\nOverview and static vs. dynamic typing\nThe term ‘type’ refers to how a given piece of information is stored and what operations can be done with the information.\n‘Primitive’ types are the most basic types that often relate directly to how data are stored in memory or on disk (e.g., boolean, integer, numeric (real-valued, aka double or floating point), character, pointer (aka address, reference).\nIn compiled languages like C and C++, one has to define the type of each variable. Such languages are statically typed. Interpreted (or scripting) languages such as Python and R have dynamic types. One can associate different types of information with a given variable name at different times and without declaring the type of the variable:\n\nx = 'hello'\nprint(x)\n\nhello\n\nx = 7\nx*3\n\n21\n\n\nIn contrast in a language like C, one has to declare a variable based on its type before using it:\n\ndouble y;\ndouble x = 3.1;\ny = x * 7.1;\n\nDynamic typing can be quite helpful from the perspective of quick implementation and avoiding tedious type definitions and problems from minor inconsistencies between types (e.g., multiplying an integer by a real-valued number). But static typing has some critical advantages from the perspective of software development, including:\n\nprotecting against errors from mismatched values and unexpected user inputs, and\ngenerally much faster execution because the type of a variable does not need to be checked when the code is run.\n\nMore complex types in Python (and in R) often use references (pointers, aka addresses) to the actual locations of the data. We’ll see this in detail when we discuss Memory.\n\n\nTypes in Python\nYou should be familiar with the important built-in data types in Python, most importantly lists, tuples, and dictionaries, as well as basic scalar types such as integers, floats, and strings.\nLet’s look at the type of various built-in data structures in Python and in numpy, which provides important types for numerical computing.\n\nx = 3\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\nx = 3.0\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'float'&gt;\n\nx = 'abc'\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'str'&gt;\n\nx = False\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'bool'&gt;\n\nx = [3, 3.0, 'abc']\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'list'&gt;\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([3, 5, 7])  ## array of integers\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\ntype(x[0])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.int64'&gt;\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 3) # array of floats (aka 'doubles')\ntype(x[0])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = (3,4)) # multi-dimensional array\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\nSometimes numpy may modify a type to make things easier for you, which often works well, but you may want to control it yourself to be sure:\n\nx = np.array([3, 5, 7.3])\nx\n\narray([3. , 5. , 7.3])\n\ntype(x[0])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;\n\nx = np.array([3.0, 5.0, 7.0]) # Force use of floats (either `3.0` or `3.`).\ntype(x[0])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;\n\nx = np.array([3, 5, 7], dtype = 'float64')\ntype(x[0])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;\n\n\nThis can come up when working on a GPU, where the default is usually 32-bit (4-byte) numbers instead of 64-bit (8-byte) numbers.\n\n\nComposite objects\nMany objects can be composite (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a dictionary of lists, tuples, and strings).\n\nmydict = {'a': 3, 'b': 7}\nmylist = [3, 5, 7]\n\nmylist[1] = mydict\nmylist\n\n[3, {'a': 3, 'b': 7}, 7]\n\nmydict['a'] = mylist\n\n\n\nMutable objects\nMost objects in Python can be modified in place (i.e., modifying only some of the object), but tuples, strings, and sets are immutable:\n\nx = (3,5,7)\ntry:\n    x[1] = 4\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\n'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n\ns = 'abc'\ns[1]\n\n'b'\n\ntry:\n    s[1] = 'y'\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\n'str' object does not support item assignment\n\n\n\n\nConverting between types\nThis also goes by the term coercion and casting. Casting often needs to be done explicitly in compiled languages and somewhat less so in interpreted languages like Python.\nWe can cast (coerce) between different basic types:\n\ny = str(x[0])\ny\n\n'3'\n\ny = int(x[0])\ntype(y)\n\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\nSome common conversions are converting numbers that are being interpreted as strings into actual numbers and converting between booleans and numeric values.\nIn some cases Python will automatically do conversions behind the scenes in a smart way (or occasionally not so smart way). Consider these attempts/examples of implicit coercion:\n\nx = np.array([False, True, True])\nx.sum()         # What do you think is going to happen?\n\n2\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\ntry:\n    x[3] = 'hat'    # What do you think is going to happen?\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\ncould not convert string to float: 'hat'\n\n  \nmyList = [1, 3, 5, 9, 4, 7]\n# myList[2.0]    # What do you think is going to happen?\n# myList[2.73]   # What do you think is going to happen?\n\nR is less strict and will do conversions in some cases that Python won’t:\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(5)\nx[2.0]\n\n[1] -0.4481371\n\nx[2.73]\n\n[1] -0.4481371\n\n\nQuestion: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different behaviors of Python and R?\n\n\nDataframes\nHopefully you’re also familiar with the Pandas dataframe type.\nPandas picked up the idea of dataframes from R and functionality is similar in many ways to what you can do with R’s dplyr package.\ndplyr and pandas provide a lot of functionality for the “split-apply-combine” framework of working with “rectangular” data. Unfortunately, using Pandas can be a bit hard to learn/remember. I suggest looking into learning polars as an alternative.\nOften analyses are done in a stratified fashion - the same operation or analysis is done on subsets of the data set. The subsets might be different time points, different locations, different hospitals, different people, etc.\nThe split-apply-combine framework is intended to operate in this kind of context: - first one splits the dataset by one or more variables, - then one does something to each subset, and - then one combines the results.\nsplit-apply-combine is also closely related to the famous Map-Reduce framework underlying big data tools such as Hadoop and Spark.\nIt’s also very similar to standard SQL queries involving filtering, grouping, and aggregation.\n\n\nPython object protocols\nThere are a number of broad categories of kinds of objects: mapping, number, sequence, iterator. These are called object protocols.\nAll objects that fall in a given category share key characteristics. For example sequence objects have a notion of “next”, while iterator objects have a notion of “stopping”.\nIf you implement your own class that falls into one of these categories, it should follow the relevant protocol by providing the required methods. For example a container class that supports iteration should provide the __iter__ and __next__ methods.\nHere we see that tuples are iterable containers:\n\nmytuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n\nfor item in mytuple:\n    print(item)\n\napple\nbanana\ncherry\n\n## We can manually create the iterator and iterate through it.\nmyit = iter(mytuple)\n## myit = mytuple.__iter__()  ## This is equivalent to using `iter(mytuple)`.\n\nprint(next(myit))\n\napple\n\nprint(next(myit))\n\nbanana\n\nmyit.__next__()   ## This is equivalent to using `next(myit)`.\n\n'cherry'\n\n\nWe’ve actually gotten ahead of ourselves – how is it that iter seems to do the same thing as mytuple.__iter__() and next seems to do the same thing as myit.__next__()? We’ll discuss that in the next section when we discuss the Python object model.\n\nx = zip(['clinton', 'bush', 'obama', 'trump'], ['Dem', 'Rep', 'Dem', 'Rep'])\nnext(x)\n\n('clinton', 'Dem')\n\nnext(x)\n\n('bush', 'Rep')\n\n\nWe can also go from an iterable object to a standard list:\n\nr = range(5)\nr\n\nrange(0, 5)\n\nlist(r)\n\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]",

    "text": "Principles\nSome of the standard concepts in object-oriented programming include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\nEncapsulation involves preventing direct access to internal data in an object from outside the object. Instead the class is designed so that access (reading or writing) happens through the interface set up by the programmer (e.g., ‘getter’ and ‘setter’ methods). However, Python actually doesn’t really enforce the notion of internal or private information.\nInheritance allows one class to be based on another class, adding more specialized features. For example in the statsmodels package, the OLS class inherits from the WLS class.\nPolymorphism allows for different behavior of an object or function depending on the context. A polymorphic function behaves differently depending on the input types. For example, think of a print function or an addition operator behaving differently depending on the type of the input argument(s). A polymorphic object is one that can belong to different classes (e.g., based on inheritance), and a given method name can be used with any of the classes. An example would be having a base or super class called ‘algorithm’ and various specific machine learning algorithms inheriting from that class. All of the classes might have a ‘predict’ method.\nAbstraction involves hiding the details of how something is done (e.g., via the method of a class), giving the user an interface to provide inputs and get outputs. By making the actual computation a black box, the programmer can modify the internals without changing how a user uses the system.\nClasses generally have constructors that initialize objects of the class and destructors that remove objects.",

    "text": "Classes in Python\nPython provides a pretty standard approach to writing object-oriented code focused on classes.\nOur example is to create a class for working with random time series. Each object of the class has specific parameter values that control the stochastic behavior of the time series. With a given object we can simulate one or more time series (realizations).\nHere’s the initial definition of the class with methods and fields (aka attributes).\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass tsSimClass:\n    '''\n    Class definition for time series simulator\n    '''\n    ## dunder methods (more later)\n    def __init__(self, times, mean = 0, cor_param = 1, seed = 1):\n        ## This is the constructor, called when `tsSimClass(...)` is invoked\n        ## to create an instance of the class.\n\n        ## For robustness, need checks that `cor_param` is numeric of length 1 and `times` is np array.\n        ## Public attributes\n        self.n = len(times)\n        self.mean = mean\n        self.cor_param = cor_param\n        ## Private attributes (encapsulation)\n        self._times = times\n        self._current_U = False\n        ## Some setup steps\n        self._calc_mats()\n        np.random.seed(seed)\n    def __str__(self):    # 'print' method\n        return f\"An object of class `tsSimClass` with {self.n} time points.\"\n    def __len__(self):\n        return self.n\n\n    ## Public methods: getter and setter (encapsulation)\n    def set_times(self, new_times):\n        self._times = new_times\n        self._current_U = False\n        self._calc_mats()\n    def get_times(self):\n        return self._times\n \n    ## Main public method\n    def simulate(self):\n        if not self._current_U:    \n            self._calc_mats()\n        ## analogous to mu+sigma*z for generating N(mu, sigma^2)\n        return self.mean + np.dot(self.U.T, np.random.normal(size = self.n))\n\n    ## Private method.\n    def _calc_mats(self):\n        ## Calculates correlation matrix and Cholesky factor (caching).\n        lag_mat = np.abs(self._times[:, np.newaxis] - self._times)\n        cor_mat = np.exp(-lag_mat ** 2 / self.cor_param ** 2)\n        self.U = np.linalg.cholesky(cor_mat)\n        print(\"Done updating correlation matrix and Cholesky factor.\")\n        self._current_U = True\n\nNow let’s see how we would use the class.\n\nmyts = tsSimClass(np.arange(1, 101), 2, 1)\n\nDone updating correlation matrix and Cholesky factor.\n\nprint(myts)\n\nAn object of class `tsSimClass` with 100 time points.\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\n## Here's a simulated time series.\ny1 = myts.simulate()\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(myts.get_times(), y1, '-')\nplt.xlabel('time')\nplt.ylabel('process values')\n## Simulate a second series.\ny2 = myts.simulate()\nplt.plot(myts.get_times(), y2, '--')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could set up a different object that has different parameter values. That new simulated time series is less wiggly because the cor_param value is larger than before.\n\nmyts2 = tsSimClass(np.arange(1, 101), 2, 4)\n\nDone updating correlation matrix and Cholesky factor.\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\n## Here's a simulated time series with a different value of\n## the correlation parameter (cor_param).\ny3 = myts2.simulate()\n\nplt.plot(myts2.get_times(), y3, '-', color = 'red')\nplt.xlabel('time')\nplt.ylabel('process values')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopies and references\nNext let’s think about when copies are made. In the next example myts_ref is a copy of myts in the sense that both names point to the same underlying object. But no data were copied when the assignment to myts_ref was done.\n\nmyts_ref = myts\n## 'myts_ref' and 'myts' are names for the same underlying object.\nimport copy\nmyts_full_copy = copy.deepcopy(myts)\n\n## Now let's change the values of a field.\nmyts.set_times(np.arange(1,1001,10))\n\nDone updating correlation matrix and Cholesky factor.\n\nmyts.get_times()[0:4] \n\narray([ 1, 11, 21, 31])\n\nmyts_ref.get_times()[0:4] # the same as `myts`\n\narray([ 1, 11, 21, 31])\n\nmyts_full_copy.get_times()[0:4] # different from `myts`\n\narray([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n\nIn contrast myts_full_copy is a reference to a different object, and all the data from myts had to be copied over to myts_full_copy. This takes additional memory (and time), but is also safer, as it avoids the possibility that the user might modify myts and not realize that they were also affecting myts_ref. We’ll discuss this more when we discuss copying in the section on memory use.\n\n\nEncapsulation\nThose of you familiar with OOP will probably be familiar with the idea of public and private fields and methods.\nWhy have private fields (i.e., encapsulation)? The use of private fields shields them from modification by users. Python doesn’t really provide this functionality but by convention, attributes whose name starts with _ are considered private. In this case, we don’t want users to modify the times field. Why is this important? In this example, the correlation matrix and the Cholesky factor U are both functions of the array of times. So we don’t want to allow a user to directly modify times. If they did, it would leave the fields of the object in inconsistent states. Instead we want them to use set_times, which correctly keeps all the fields in the object internally consistent (by calling _calc_mats). It also allows us to improve efficiency by controlling when computationally expensive operations are carried out.\nIn a module, objects that start with _ are a weak form of private attributes. Users can access them, but from foo import * does not import them.\n\n\nInheritance\nInheritance can be a powerful way to reduce code duplication and keep your code organized in a logical (nested) fashion. Special cases can be simple extensions of more general classes. A good example of inheritance in Python and R is how regression models are handled. E.g., in Python’s statsmodels package, the OLS class inherits from the WLS class.\n\nclass Bear:\n      def __init__(self, name, age):\n          self.name = name\n          self.age = age\n      def __str__(self):\n          return f\"A bear named '{self.name}' of age {self.age}.\"\n      def color(self):\n          return \"unknown\"\n\nclass GrizzlyBear(Bear):\n      def __init__(self, name, age, num_people_killed = 0):\n          super().__init__(name, age)\n          self.num_people_killed = num_people_killed\n      def color(self):  \n          return \"brown\"\n\nyog = Bear(\"Yogi the Bear\", 23)\nprint(yog)\n\nA bear named 'Yogi the Bear' of age 23.\n\nyog.color()\n\n'unknown'\n\nnum399 = GrizzlyBear(\"Jackson Hole Grizzly 399\", 35)\nprint(num399)\n\nA bear named 'Jackson Hole Grizzly 399' of age 35.\n\nnum399.color()\n\n'brown'\n\nnum399.num_people_killed\n\n0\n\n\nHere the GrizzlyBear class has additional fields/methods beyond those inherited from the base class (the Bear class), i.e., num_people_killed (since grizzly bears are much more dangerous than some other kinds of bears), and perhaps additional or modified methods. Python uses the methods specific to the GrizzlyBear class if present before falling back to methods of the Bear class if not present in the GrizzlyBear class.\nThe above is an example of polymorphism. Instances of the GrizzlyBear class are polymorphic because they can have behavior from both the GrizzlyBear and Bear classes. The color method is polymorphic in that it can be used for both classes but is defined to behave differently depending on the class.",

    "text": "Generic function OOP\nLet’s consider the len function in Python. It seems to work magically on various kinds of objects.\n\nx = [3, 5, 7]\nlen(x)\n\n3\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nlen(x)\n\n5\n\nx = {'a': 2, 'b': 3}\nlen(x)\n\n2\n\n\nSuppose you were writing the len function. What would you have to do to make it work as it did above? What would happen if a user wants to use len with a class that they define?\nInstead, Python implements the len function by calling the __len__ method of the class that the argument belongs to.\n\nx = {'a': 2, 'b': 3}\nlen(x)\n\n2\n\nx.__len__()\n\n2\n\n\n__len__ is a dunder method (a “Double-UNDERscore” method), which we’ll discuss more in a bit.\nSomething similar occurs with operators:\n\nx = 3\nx + 5\n\n8\n\nx = 'abc'\nx + 'xyz'\n\n'abcxyz'\n\nx.__add__('xyz')\n\n'abcxyz'\n\n\nThis use of generic functions is convenient in that it allows us to work with a variety of kinds of objects using familiar functions.\nThe use of such generic functions and operators is similar in spirit to function or method overloading in C++ and Java. It is also how the (very) old S3 system in R works. And it’s a key part of the (fairly) new Julia language.\n\nWhy use generic functions?\nThe Python developers could have written len as a regular function with a bunch of if statements so that it can handle different kinds of input objects.\nThis has some disadvantages:\n\nWe need to write the code that does the checking.\nFurthermore, all the code for the different cases all lives inside one potentially very long function, unless we create class-specific helper functions.\nMost importantly, len will only work for existing classes. And users can’t easily extend it for new classes that they create because they don’t control the len (built-in) function. So a user could not add the additional conditions/classes in a big if-else statement. The generic function approach makes the system extensible – we can build our own new functionality on top of what is already in Python.\n\n\nThe print function\nLike len, print is a generic function, with various class-specific methods.\nWe can write a print method for our own class by defining the __str__ method as well as a __repr__ method giving what to display when the name of an object is typed.\n\nclass Bear:\n      def __init__(self, name, age):\n          self.name = name\n          self.age = age\n\nyog = Bear(\"Yogi the Bear\", 23)\nprint(yog)\n\n&lt;__main__.Bear object at 0x7f86da0d1a90&gt;\n\nclass Bear:\n      def __init__(self, name, age):\n          self.name = name\n          self.age = age\n      def __str__(self):\n          return f\"A bear named {self.name} of age {self.age}.\"\n      def __repr__(self):\n          return f\"Bear(name={self.name}, age={self.age})\"\n\nyog = Bear(\"Yogi the Bear\", 23)\nprint(yog)   # Invokes __str__\n\nA bear named Yogi the Bear of age 23.\n\nyog          # Invokes __repr__\n\nBear(name=Yogi the Bear, age=23)\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple dispatch OOP\nThe dispatch system involved in len and + involves only the first argument to the function (or operator). In contrast, Julia emphasizes the importance of multiple dispatch as particularly important for mathematical computation. With multiple dispatch, the specific method can be chosen based on more than one argument.\nIn R, the old (but still used in some contexts) S4 system in R and the new R7 system both provide for multiple dispatch.\nAs a very simple example unrelated to any specific language, multiple dispatch would allow one to do the following with the addition operator:\n3 + 7    # 10\n3 + 'a'  # '3a'\n'hi' +  ' there'  # 'hi there'\nThe idea of having the behavior of an operator or function adapt to the type of the input(s) is one aspect of polymorphism.",

    "section": "Functional programming (in Python)",
    "text": "Functional programming (in Python)\n\nOverview of functional programming\nFunctional programming is an approach to programming that emphasizes the use of modular, self-contained functions. Such functions should operate only on arguments provided to them (avoiding global variables), and produce no side effects, although in some cases there are good reasons for making an exception. Another aspect of functional programming is that functions are considered ‘first-class’ citizens in that they can be passed as arguments to another function, returned as the result of a function, and assigned to variables. In other words, a function can be treated as any other variable.\nIn many cases (including Python and R), anonymous functions (also called ‘lambda functions’) can be created on-the-fly for use in various circumstances.\nOne can do functional programming in Python by focusing on writing modular, self-contained functions rather than classes. And functions are first-class citizens. However, there are aspects of Python that do not align with the principles mentioned above.\n\nPython’s pass-by-reference behavior causes functions to potentially have the important side effects of modifying arguments that are mutable (e.g., lists and numpy arrays but not tuples) if the programmer is not careful about not modifying arguments within functions.\nSome operations are carried out by statements (e.g., import, def) rather than functions.\n\nIn contrast, R functions have pass-by-value behavior, which is more consistent with a pure functional programming approach.\n\n\nThe principle of no side effects\nBefore we discuss Python further, let’s consider how R behaves in more detail as R conforms more strictly to a functional programming perspective.\nMost functions available in R (and ideally functions that you write as well) operate by taking in arguments and producing output that is then (presumably) used subsequently. The functions generally don’t have any effect on the state of your R environment/session other than the output they produce.\nAn important reason for this (plus for not using global variables) is that it means that it is easy for people using the language to understand what code does. Every function can be treated a black box – you don’t need to understand what happens in the function or worry that the function might do something unexpected (such as changing the value of one of your variables). The result of running code is simply the result of a composition of functions, as in mathematical function composition.\nOne aspect of this is that R uses a pass-by-value approach to function arguments. In R (but not Python), when you pass an object in as an argument and then modify it in the function, you are modifying a local copy of the variable that exists in the context (the frame) of the function and is deleted when the function call finishes:\n\nx &lt;- 1:3\nmyfun &lt;- function(x) {\n      x[2] &lt;- 7\n      print(x)\n      return(x)\n}\n\nnew_x &lt;- myfun(x)\n\n[1] 1 7 3\n\nx   # unmodified\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nIn contrast, Python uses a pass-by-reference approach, seen here:\n\nx = np.array([1,2,3])\ndef myfun(x):\n  x[1] = 7\n  return x\n\nnew_x = myfun(x)\nx   # modified!\n\narray([1, 7, 3])\n\n\nAnd actually, given the pass-by-reference behavior, we would probably use a version of myfun that looks like this:\n\nx = np.array([1,2,3])\ndef myfun(x):\n  x[1] = 7\n  return None\n\nmyfun(x)\nx   # modified!\n\narray([1, 7, 3])\n\n\nNote how easy it would be for a Python programmer to violate the ‘no side effects’ principle. In fact to avoid it, we need to do some additional work in terms of making a copy of x to a new location in memory before modifying it in the function.\n\nx = np.array([1,2,3])\ndef myfun(x):\n  y = x.copy()\n  y[1] = 7\n  return y\n\nnew_x = myfun(x)\nx   # no side effects!\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\nMore on pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference later.\nEven in R, there are some (necessary) exceptions to the idea of no side effects, such as par(), library(), and plot().\n\n\nFunctions are first-class objects\nEverything in Python is an object, including functions and classes. We can assign functions to variables in the same way we assign numeric and other values.\nWhen we make an assignment we associate a name (a ‘reference’) with an object in memory. Python can find the object by using the name to look up the object in the namespace.\n\nx = 3\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\ntry:\n    x([1,3,5])  # x is not a function (yet)\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\n'int' object is not callable\n\nx = sum\n\nx([1,3,5])\n\n9\n\ntype(x)\n\n&lt;class 'builtin_function_or_method'&gt;\n\n\nWe can call a function based on the text name of the function.\n\nfunction = getattr(np, \"mean\")\nfunction(np.array([1,2,3]))\n\n2.0\n\n\nWe can also pass a function into another function as the actual function object. This is an important aspect of functional programming. We can do it with our own function or (as we’ll see shortly) with various built-in functions, such as map.\n\ndef apply_fun(fun, a):\n    return fun(a)\n\napply_fun(round, 3.5)\n\n4\n\n\nA function that takes a function as an argument, returns a function as a result, or both is known as a higher-order function.\n\n\nWhich operations are function calls?\nPython provides various statements that are not formal function calls but allow one to modify the current Python session:\n\nimport: import modules or packages\ndef: define functions or classes\nreturn: return results from a function\ndel: remove an object\n\nAs we saw earlier with + (__add__), operators are examples of generic function OOP, where the appropriate method of the class of the first operand is called.\n\nx = np.array([0,1,2])\nx - 1\n\narray([-1,  0,  1])\n\nx.__sub__(1)\n\narray([-1,  0,  1])\n\nx\n\narray([0, 1, 2])\n\n\nNote that the use of the operator does not modify the object.\n(Note that you can use return(x) and del(x) but behind the scenes the Python interpreter is intepreting those as return x and del x.)\n\n\nMap operations\nA map operation takes a function and runs the function on each element of some collection of items, analogous to a mathematical map. This kind of operation is very commonly used in programming, particularly functional programming, and often makes for clean, concise, and readable code.\nPython provides a variety of map-type functions: map (a built-in) and pandas.apply. These are examples of higher-order functions – functions that take a function as an argument. Another map-type operation is list comprehension, shown here:\n\nx = [1,2,3]\ny = [pow(val, 2) for val in x]\ny\n\n[1, 4, 9]\n\n\nIn Python, map is run on the elements of an iterable object. Such objects include lists as well as the result of range() and other functions that produce iterables.\n\nx = [1.0, -2.7, 3.5, -5.1]\nlist(map(abs, x))\n\n[1.0, 2.7, 3.5, 5.1]\n\nlist(map(pow, x, [2,2,2,2]))\n\n[1.0, 7.290000000000001, 12.25, 26.009999999999998]\n\n\nOr we can use lambda functions to define a function on the fly:\n\nx = [1.0, -2.7, 3.5, -5.1]\nresult = list(map(lambda vals: vals * 2, x))\n\nA lambda function is a temporary function that is defined “on-the-fly” rather than in advance and is never given a name. (These are also sometimes called anonymous functions.)\nIf you need to pass another argument to the function you can use a lambda function as above or functools.partial:\n\nfrom functools import partial\n\n# Create a new round function with 'ndigits' argument pre-set\nround3 = partial(round, ndigits = 3)\n\n# Apply the function to a list of numbers\nlist(map(round3, [32.134234, 7.1, 343.7775]))\n\n[32.134, 7.1, 343.777]\n\n\nLet’s compare using a map-style operation (with Pandas) to using a for loop to run a stratified analysis for a generic example (this code won’t run because the variables don’t exist):\n\n# stratification \nsubsets = df.groupby('grouping_variable')\n\n# map using pandas.apply: one line, easy to understand\nresults = subsets.apply(analysis_function)\n\n# for loop: needs storage set up and multiple lines\nresults &lt;- []\nfor _,subset in subsets:   # iterate over the key-value pairs (the subsets)\n  results.append(analysis_function(subset))\n\nMap operations are also at the heart of the famous MapReduce framework, used in Hadoop and Spark for big data processing.",

    "text": "Function evaluation, frames, and the call stack\n\nOverview\nWhen we run code, we end up calling functions inside of other function calls. This leads to a nested series of function calls. The series of calls is the call stack. The stack operates like a stack of cafeteria trays - when a function is called, it is added to the stack (pushed) and when it finishes, it is removed (popped).\nUnderstanding the series of calls is important when reading error messages and debugging. In Python, when an error occurs, the call stack is shown, which has the advantage of giving the complete history of what led to the error and the disadvantage of producing often very verbose output that can be hard to understand. (In contrast, in R, only the function in which the error occurs is shown, but you can see the full call stack by invoking traceback().)\nWhat happens when an Python function is evaluated?\n\nThe user-provided function arguments are evaluated in the calling scope and the results are matched to the argument names in the function definition.\nA new frame containing a new namespace is created to store information related to the function call and placed on the stack. Assignment to the argument names is done in the namespace, including any default arguments.\nThe function is evaluated in the (new) local scope. Any look-up of variables not found in the local scope (using the namespace that was created) is done using the lexical scoping rules to look in the series of enclosing scopes (if any exist), then in the global/module scope, and then in the built-ins scope.\nWhen the function finishes, the return value is passed back to the calling scope and the frame is taken off the stack. The namespace is removed, unless the namespace is the enclosing scope for an existing namespace.\n\nI’m not expecting you to fully understand that previous paragraph and all the terms in it yet. We’ll see all the details as we proceed through this Unit.\n\n\nFrames and the call stack\nPython keeps track of the call stack. Each function call is associated with a frame that has a namespace that contains the local variables for that function call.\nThere are a bunch of functions that let us query what frames are on the stack and access objects in particular frames of interest. This gives us the ability to work with objects in the frame from which a function was called.\nWe can use functions from the traceback package to query the call stack.\n\nimport traceback\n\ndef function_a():\n    function_b()  # line 2 within function, line 4 overall\n\ndef function_b():\n    # some comment\n    # another comment\n    function_c()  # line 4 within function, line 9 overall\n\ndef function_c():\n    traceback.print_stack() # line 2 within, line 12 overall\n    # raise RuntimeError(\"A fake error\")\n\nfunction_a()    # line 1 relative to the call, line 15 overall\n\nIf we run that in Python (not via rendering the qmd file directly, because the line numbering shown is strange when things go through the quarto rendering process), we see this:\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 2, in function_a\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 4, in function_b\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 2, in function_c\nIf we run the code by putting it in a module, say file.py and running python file.py, we see this, with the line numbering relative to the overall file, but showing the same stack of function calls:\n  File \"file.py\", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;\n    function_a()    # line 1 relative to the call, line 15 overall\n  File \"file.py\", line 4, in function_a\n    function_b()  # line 2 within function, line 4 overall\n  File \"file.py\", line 9, in function_b\n    function_c()  # line 4 within function, line 9 overall\n  File \"file.py\", line 12, in function_c\n    traceback.print_stack() # line 2 within, line 12 overall\nIf we comment out the print_stack() call and uncomment the error, we see the same traceback information. That’s exactly what is happening when you get a long series of information when Python stops with an error.",

(‘args’ is a convention - you can call it something else).

You’d need to also have **kwargs as an argument to handle keyword arguments.

    "section": "Pass by value vs. pass by reference",
    "text": "Pass by value vs. pass by reference\nWhen talking about programming languages, one often distinguishes pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.\nPass-by-value means that when a function is called with one or more arguments, a copy is made of each argument and the function operates on those copies. In pass-by-value, changes to an argument made within a function do not affect the value of the argument in the calling environment.\nPass-by-reference means that the arguments are not copied, but rather that information is passed allowing the function to find and modify the original value of the objects passed into the function. In pass-by-reference changes inside a function can affect the object outside of the function.\nPass-by-value is elegant and modular in that functions do not have side effects - the effect of the function occurs only through the return value of the function. However, it can be inefficient in terms of the amount of computation and of memory used. In contrast, pass-by-reference is more efficient, but also more dangerous and less modular. It’s more difficult to reason about code that uses pass-by-reference because effects of calling a function can be hidden inside the function. Thus pass-by-value is directly related to functional programming.\nArrays and other non-scalar objects in Python are pass-by-reference (but note that tuples are immutable, so one could not modify a tuple that is passed as an argument).\n\ndef myfun(x):\n    x[1] = 99\n\ny = [0, 1, 2]\nz = myfun(y)\ntype(z)\n\n&lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;\n\ny\n\n[0, 99, 2]\n\n\nLet’s see what operations cause arguments modified in a function to affect state outside of the function:\n\ndef myfun(f_scalar, f_x, f_x_new, f_x_newid, f_x_copy):\n\n    # `scalar` in global unaffected, as `f_scalar` is redefined.\n    f_scalar = 99              \n\n    # `x` in global is MODIFIED, as `x` and `f_x` have same id.\n    f_x[0] = 99                 \n\n    # `x_new` in global unaffected as `f_x_new` is redefined.\n    f_x_new = [99,2,3]        \n\n    # `x_newid` in global is MODIFIED as `x_newid` and `y` have same id.\n    y = f_x_newid\n    y[0] = 99              \n\n    # `x_copy` in global is unaffected as `x_copy` has different id from `z`\n    z = f_x_copy.copy() \n    z[0] = 99              \n\n\nscalar = 1\nx = [1,2,3]\nx_new = [1,2,3]\nx_newid = [1,2,3]\nx_copy = [1,2,3]\n\n\nmyfun(scalar, x, x_new, x_newid, x_copy)\n\nHere are the cases where state is preserved:\n\nscalar\n\n1\n\nx_new\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nx_copy\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nAnd here are the cases where state is modified:\n\nx\n\n[99, 2, 3]\n\nx_newid\n\n[99, 2, 3]\n\n\nBasically if you replace the reference (object name) then the state outside the function is preserved. That’s because a new local variable in the function scope is created. If you modify part of the object, state is not preserved.\nThe same behavior occurs with other mutable objects such as numpy arrays.\n\nPointers (optional)\nTo put pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference in a broader context, I want to briefly discuss the idea of a pointer, common in compiled languages such as C.\n\nint x = 3;\nint* ptr;\nptr = &x;\n*ptr * 7; // returns 21\n\n\nint x=3 declares x to be an int and immediately defines it to have the value 3.\nThe int* declares ptr to be a pointer to (the address of) the integer x.\n&x gets the address where x is stored.\n*ptr dereferences ptr, returning the value in that address (which is 3 since ptr is the address of x.\n\nArrays in C are really pointers to a block of memory:\n\nint x[10];\n\nIn this case x will be the address of the first element of the array. We can access the first element as x[0] or *x.\nWhy have we gone into this? In C, you can pass a pointer as an argument to a function. The result is that only the scalar address is copied and not the entire object, and inside the function, one can modify the original object, with the new value persisting on exit from the function. For example in the following example one passes in the address of an object and that object is then modified in place, affecting its value when the function call finishes.\n\nint myCal(int* ptr){\n    *ptr = *ptr + *ptr;\n}\n\nmyCal(&x)  # x itself will be modified\n\nSo Python behaves similarly to the use of pointers in C.",

    "text": "Namespaces and scopes\nAs discussed here in the Python docs, a namespace is a mapping from names to objects that allows Python to find objects by name via clear rules that enforce modularity and avoid name conflicts.\nNamespaces are created and removed through the course of executing Python code. When a function is run, a namespace for the local variables in the function is created, and then deleted when the function finishes executing. Separate function calls (including recursive calls) have separate namespaces.\nScope is closely related concept – a scope determines what namespaces are accessible from a given place in one’s code. Scopes are nested and determine where and in what order Python searches the various namespaces for objects.\nNote that the ideas of namespaces and scopes are relevant in most other languages, though the details of how they work can differ.\nThese ideas are very important for modularity, isolating the names of objects to avoid conflicts.\nThis allows you to use the same name in different modules or submodules, as well as different packages using the same name.\nOf course to make the objects in a module or package available we need to use import.\nConsider what happens if you have two modules that both use x and you import x using from.\n\nfrom mypkg.mymod import x\nfrom mypkg.mysubpkg import x\nx  # which x is used?\n\nWe’ve added x twice to the namespace of the global scope.

This is also the local scope if the code is not executing inside a function.\nBuilt-ins scope: objects provided by Python through the built-ins module but available from anywhere.\n\nNote that import adds the name of the imported module to the namespace of the current (i.e., local) scope.\nWe can see the local and global namespaces using locals() and globals().\n\ncat local.py\n\ngx = 7\n\ndef myfun(z):\n    y = z*3\n    print(\"local: \", locals())\n    print(\"global: \", globals())\n\n\nRun the following code to see what is in the different namespaces:\n\nimport local\n\ngx = 99\nlocal.myfun(3)\n\nStrangely (for me being more used to R, where package namespaces are ‘locked’ such that objects can’t be added), we can add an object to a namespace created from a module or package:\n\nmymod.x = 33\ndir(mymod)\n\n['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'myfun', 'range', 'x']\n\nimport numpy as np\nnp.x = 33\n'x' in dir(np)\n\nTrue\n\n\nAs more motivation, consider this example.\nSuppose we have this code in a module named test_scope.py:\n\ncat test_scope.py\n\nmagic_number = 2\n\ndef transform(x):\n    return x*5\n\ndef myfun(val):\n    return(transform(val) * magic_number)\n\n\nNow suppose we also define magic_number and transform() in the scope in which myfun is called from.\n\nimport test_scope\nmagic_number = 900\ndef transform(x):\n   print(\"haha\")\n\ntest_scope.myfun(3)\n\n30\n\n\nWe see that Python uses magic_number and transform() from the module. What would be bad about using magic_number or transform() from the scope of the Python session rather than the scope of the module?\nConsider a case where instead of using the test_scope.py module we were using code from a package and that code has a variable called magic_number or function called transform.\n\nLexical scoping (enclosing scopes)\nIn this section, we seek to understand what happens in the following circumstance. Namely, where does Python get the value for the object x?\n\ndef f(y):\n  return x + y\n\nf(3)\n\nVariables in the enclosing scope are available within a function. The enclosing scope is the scope in which a function is defined, not the scope from which a function is called.\nThis approach is called lexical scoping. R and many other languages also use lexical scoping.\nThe behavior of looking up object names based on where functions are defined rather than where they are called from extends the local-global scoping discussed in the previous section, with similar motivation.\nLet’s dig deeper to understand where Python looks for non-local variables, illustrating lexical scoping:\n\n## Case 1\nx = 3\ndef f2():\n    print(x)\n\ndef f():\n    x = 7\n    f2()\n\nf() # what will happen?\n\n## Case 2\nx = 3\ndef f2()\n    print(x)\n\ndef f():\n    x = 7\n    f2()\n\nx = 100\nf() # what will happen?\n\n## Case 3\nx = 3\ndef f():\n    def f2():\n        print(x)        \n    x = 7\n    f2()\n\nx = 100\nf() # what will happen?\n\n## Case 4\nx = 3\ndef f():\n    def f2():\n        print(x)\n    f2()\n\nx = 100\nf() # what will happen?\n\nHere’s a tricky example:\n\ny = 100\ndef fun_constructor():\n    y = 10\n    def g(x):\n            return x + y     \n    return g\n\n## fun_constructor() creates functions\nmyfun = fun_constructor()\nmyfun(3)\n\nLet’s work through this:\n\nWhat is the enclosing scope for the function g()?\nWhich y does g() use?\nWhere is myfun defined (this is tricky – how does myfun relate to g)?\nWhat is the enclosing scope for myfun()?\nWhen fun_constructor() finishes, does its namespace disappear? What would happen if it did?\nWhat does myfun use for y?\n\nWe can use the inspect package to see information about the closure.\n\nimport inspect\ninspect.getclosurevars(myfun)\n\nClosureVars(nonlocals={}, globals={'copy': &lt;module 'copy' from '/system/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/copy.py'&gt;}, builtins={}, unbound=set())\n\n\n(Note that I haven’t fully investigated the use of inspect, but it looks like it has a lot of useful tools.)\nBe careful when using variables from non-local scopes as the value of that variable may well not be what you expect it to be. In general one wants to think carefully before using variables that are taken from outside the local scope, but in some cases it can be useful.\nNext we’ll see some ways of accessing variables outside of the local scope.\n\n\nGlobal and non-local variables\nWe can create and modify global variables and variables in the enclosing scope using global and nonlocal respectively. Note that global is in the context of the current module so this could be a variable in your current Python session if you’re working with functions defined in that session or a global variable in a module or package.\n\ndel x\n\ndef myfun():\n    global x\n    x = 7\n\nmyfun()\nprint(x)\n\n7\n\nx = 9\nmyfun()\nprint(x)\n\n7\n\n\n\ndef outer_function():\n    x = 10  # Outer variable\n    def inner_function():\n        nonlocal x\n        x = 20  # Modify the outer variable.\n    print(x)  # Output: 10\n    inner_function()\n    print(x)  # Output: 20\n\nouter_function()\n\n10\n20\n\n\nIn R, one can do similar things using the global assignment operator &lt;&lt;-.\n\n\nClosures\nOne way to associate data with functions is to use a closure. This is a functional programming way to achieve something like an OOP class. This Wikipedia entry nicely summarizes the idea, which is a general functional programming idea and not specific to Python.\nUsing a closure involves creating one (or more functions) within a function call and returning the function(s) as the output. When one executes the original function (the constructor), the new function(s) is created and returned and one can then call that function(s). The function then can access objects in the enclosing scope (the scope of the constructor) and can use nonlocal to assign into the enclosing scope, to which the function (or the multiple functions) have access. The nice thing about this compared to using a global variable is that the data in the closure is bound up with the function(s) and is protected from being changed by the user.\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\ndef scaler_constructor(input):\n    data = input\n    def g(param):\n            return param * data\n    return g\n\nscaler = scaler_constructor(x)\ndel x # to demonstrate we no longer need x\nscaler(3)\n\narray([ 0.5081473 ,  2.22166935, -2.86110181, -0.79865552,  0.09784364])\n\nscaler(6)\n\narray([ 1.0162946 ,  4.44333871, -5.72220361, -1.59731104,  0.19568728])\n\n\nSo calling scaler(3) multiplies 3 by the value of data stored in the closure (the namespace of the enclosing scope) of the function scaler.\nNote that it can be hard to see the memory use involved in the closure.\nHere’s a more realistic example. There are other ways you could do this, but this is slick:\n\ndef make_container(n):\n    x = np.zeros(n)\n    i = 0\n    def store(value = None):\n        nonlocal x, i\n        if value is None:\n            return x\n        else:\n            x[i] = value\n            i += 1\n    return store\n\n\nnboot = 20\nbootmeans = make_container(nboot)\n\nimport pandas as pd\niris = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/iris.csv')\ndata = iris['SepalLength']\n\nfor i in range(nboot): \n    bootmeans(np.mean(np.random.choice(data, size = len(data), replace = True)))\n\n\nbootmeans()\n\narray([5.874     , 5.95533333, 5.86      , 5.754     , 5.77466667,\n       5.81733333, 5.902     , 5.79933333, 5.842     , 5.81933333,\n       5.854     , 5.97      , 5.84      , 5.80133333, 5.99333333,\n       5.88133333, 5.83133333, 5.84533333, 5.91466667, 5.79666667])\n\nbootmeans.__closure__\n\n(&lt;cell at 0x7f86da0f3f10: int object at 0x7f86e66f6f28&gt;, &lt;cell at 0x7f86da0f0250: numpy.ndarray object at 0x7f86da134990&gt;)",

Now the function name refers to the wrapped version of the function.\n\n@verbosity_wrapper\ndef myfun(x):\n    return x\n\ny = myfun(7)\n\nStarting myfun.\nFinishing myfun.\n\ny\n\n7\n\n\nOur decorator doesn’t do anything useful, but hopefully you can imagine that the idea of being able to have more control over the operation of functions could be useful. For example we could set up a timing wrapper so that when we run a function, we get a report on how long it took to run the function. Or using the idea of a closure, we could keep a running count of the number of times a function has been called.\nOne real-world example of using decorators is in setting up functions to run in parallel in dask, which we’ll discuss in Unit 7. Another is the use of Numba to do just-in-time (JIT) compilation of Python code.",

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe main things to remember when thinking about memory use are: (1) numeric arrays take 8 bytes per element and (2) we need to keep track of when large objects are created, including local variables in the frames of functions.\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nx.itemsize # 8 bytes\n\n8\n\nx.nbytes\n\n40\n\n\n\nAllocating and freeing memory\nUnlike compiled languages like C, in Python we do not need to explicitly allocate storage for objects. (However, we will see that there are times that we do want to allocate storage in advance, rather than successively concatenating onto a larger object.)\nPython automatically manages memory, releasing memory back to the operating system when it’s not needed via a process called garbage collection. Very occasionally you may want to remove large objects as soon as they are not needed. del does not actually free up memory, it just disassociates the name from the memory used to store the object. In general Python will quickly clean up such objects without a reference (i.e., a name), so there is generally no need to call gc.collect() to force the garbage collection.\nIn a language like C in which the user allocates and frees up memory, memory leaks are a major cause of bugs. Basically if you are looping and you allocate memory at each iteration and forget to free it, the memory use builds up inexorably and eventually the machine runs out of memory. In Python, with automatic garbage collection, this is generally not an issue, but occasionally memory leaks could occur.\n\n\nThe heap and the stack\nThe heap is the memory that is available for dynamically creating new objects while a program is executing, e.g., if you create a new object in Python or call new in C++. When more memory is needed the program can request more from the operating system. When objects are removed in Python, Python will handle the garbage collection of releasing that memory.\nThe stack is the memory used for local variables when a function is called. I.e., the stack is the memory associated with function frames. Hence the term “stack trace” to refer to the active function frames during execution of code.\nThere’s a nice discussion of this on this Stack Overflow thread.",

    "section": "Monitoring memory use",
    "text": "Monitoring memory use\n\nMonitoring overall memory use on a UNIX-style computer\nTo understand how much memory is available on your computer, one needs to have a clear understanding of disk caching. The operating system will generally cache files/data in memory when it reads from disk. Then if that information is still in memory the next time it is needed, it will be much faster to access it the second time around than if it had to read the information from disk. While the cached information is using memory, that same memory is immediately available to other processes, so the memory is available even though it is “in use”.\nWe can see this via free -h (the -h is for ‘human-readable’, i.e. show in GB (G)) on Linux machine.\n          total used free shared buff/cache available \n    Mem:   251G 998M 221G   2.6G        29G      247G \n    Swap:  7.6G 210M 7.4G\nYou’ll generally be interested in the Mem row. (See below for some comments on Swap.) The shared column is complicated and probably won’t be of use to you. The buff/cache column shows how much space is used for disk caching and related purposes but is actually available. Hence the available column is the sum of the free and buff/cache columns (more or less). In this case only about 1 GB is in use (indicated in the used column).\ntop (Linux or Mac) and vmstat (on Linux) both show overall memory use, but remember that the amount actually available to you is the amount free plus any buff/cache usage. Here is some example output from vmstat:\n\n    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu----- \n    r b   swpd      free   buff    cache si so bi bo in cs us sy id wa st \n    1 0 215140 231655120 677944 30660296  0  0  1  2  0  0 18  0 82  0  0\nIt shows 232 GB free and 31 GB used for cache and therefore available, for a total of 263 GB available.\nHere are some example lines from top:\n    KiB Mem : 26413715+total, 23180236+free, 999704 used, 31335072 buff/cache \n    KiB Swap:  7999484 total,  7784336 free, 215148 used. 25953483+avail Mem\nWe see that this machine has 264 GB RAM (the total column in the Mem row), with 259.5 GB available (232 GB free plus 31 GB buff/cache as seen in the Mem row). (I realize the numbers don’t quite add up for reasons I don’t fully understand, but we probably don’t need to worry about that degree of exactness.) Only 1 GB is in use.\nSwap is essentially the reverse of disk caching. It is disk space that is used for memory when the machine runs out of physical memory. You never want your machine to be using swap for memory because your jobs will slow to a crawl. As seen above, the swap line in both free and top shows 8 GB swap space, with very little in use, as desired.\n\n\nMonitoring memory use in Python\nThere are a number of ways to see how much memory is being used. When Python is actively executing statements, you can use top from the UNIX shell.\nIn Python, we can call out to the system to get the info we want:\n\nimport psutil\n\n# Get memory information\nmemory_info = psutil.Process().memory_info()\n\n# Print the memory usage\nprint(\"Memory usage:\", memory_info.rss/10**6, \" Mb.\")\n\nMemory usage: 365.707264  Mb.\n\n\n# Let's turn that into a function for later use:\ndef mem_used():\n    print(\"Memory usage:\", psutil.Process().memory_info().rss/10**6, \" Mb.\")\n\nWe can see the size of an object (in bytes) with sys.getsizeof().\n\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsys.getsizeof(my_list)\n\n104\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**7) # should use about 80 Mb\nsys.getsizeof(x)\n\n80000112\n\n\nHowever, we need to be careful about objects that refer to other objects:\n\ny = [3, x]\nsys.getsizeof(y)  # Whoops!\n\n72\n\n\nHere’s a trick where we serialize the object, as if to export it, and then see how long the binary representation is.\n\nimport pickle\nser_object = pickle.dumps(y)\nsys.getsizeof(ser_object)\n\n80000201\n\n\nThere are also some flags that one can start python with that allow one to see information about memory use and allocation. See man python. You could also look into the memory_profiler or pympler packages.",

Running that code causes execution of obj[0], and the result is passed into id. That creates a new temporary object that is passed to id. The temporary object references the same object that obj[0] does, so we find out the id of obj[0].\n\n\nHow character strings are stored.\nSimilar tricks are used for storing strings (and also integers). We may explore this in a problem set problem.\n\n\nHow numpy arrays are stored\nTo do vectorized calculations and linear algebra efficiently, one needs the data in arrays stored contiguously in memory, and this is how numpy arrays are stored. We’ve seen that a numpy array involves the actual numbers plus 112 bytes of metadata/overhead associated with the object.\nWe can’t usefully call id on elements of the array. Consider this:\n\nx = np.random.normal(size=5)\ntype(x[1])\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;\n\nid(x[1])\n\n140216979524400\n\ntmp1 = x[1]\ntmp2 = x[1]\nid(tmp1)\n\n140216979524240\n\nid(tmp2)\n\n140216978845232\n\n\nEach time we get the x[1] element we are creating a new numpy float64 scalar object. This is because each element of the array is not its own object (unlike a list element) so extracting the element involves copying the value and making a new object.\nAnother indication of the array being stored contiguously is that if we pickle the array, its size is just a bit more than the size needed just to store the 8-byte numbers. If we instead pickle a list containing those same numbers, the result is more than twice as big, related to the pointers involved in referring to the individual numbers.\n\n\nModifying elements in place\nWhat do this simple experiment tell us?\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nid(x)\n\n140216979393392\n\nx[2] = 3.5\nid(x)\n\n140216979393392\n\n\nIt makes some sense that modifying elements of an object here doesn’t cause a copy – if it did, working with large objects would be very difficult.\n\n\n\nWhen are copies made?\nLet’s try to understand when Python uses additional memory for objects, and how it knows when it can delete memory. We’ll use large objects so that we can use free or top to see how memory use by the Python process changes.\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**8)\nid(x)\n\n140216979393008\n\ny = x\nid(y)\n\n140216979393008\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**8)\nid(x)\n\n140216979393392\n\n\nOnly if we re-assign x to reference a different object does additional memory get used.\n\nHow does Python know when it can free up memory?\nPython keeps track of how many names refer to an object and only removes memory when there are no remaining references to an object.\n\nimport sys\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**8)\ny = x\nsys.getrefcount(y)\n\n3\n\ndel x\nsys.getrefcount(y)\n\n2\n\ndel y\n\nWe can see the number of references using sys.getrefcount. Confusingly, the number is one higher than we’d expect, because it includes the temporary reference from passing the object as the argument to getrefcount.\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nsys.getrefcount(x)  # In reality, only 1. \n\n2\n\ny = x\nsys.getrefcount(x)  # In reality, 2.\n\n3\n\nsys.getrefcount(y)  # In reality, 2.\n\n3\n\ndel y\nsys.getrefcount(x)  # In reality, only 1. \n\n2\n\ny = x\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nsys.getrefcount(y)  # In reality, only 1. \n\n2\n\nsys.getrefcount(x)  # In reality, only 1. \n\n2\n\n\nThis notion of reference counting occurs in other contexts, such as shared pointers in C++ and in how R handles copying and garbage collection.",

    "section": "Interpreters and compilation",
    "text": "Interpreters and compilation\n\nWhy are interpreted languages slow?\nCompiled code runs quickly because the original code has been translated into instructions (machine language) that the processor can understand (i.e., zeros and ones). In the process of doing so, various checking and lookup steps are done once and don’t need to be redone when running the compiled code.\nIn contrast, when one runs code in an interpreted language such as Python or R, the interpreter needs to do all the checking and lookup each time the code is run. This is required because the types and locations in memory of the variables could have changed.\nWe’ll focus on Python in the following discussion, but most of the concepts apply to other interpreted languages.\nFor example, consider this code:\n\nx = 3\nabs(x)\nx*7\n\nx = 'hi'\nabs(x)\nx*3\n\nBecause of dynamic typing, when the interpreter sees abs(x) it needs to check if x is something to which the absolute value function can be applied, including dealing with the fact that x could be a list or array with many numbers in it. In addition it needs to (using scoping rules) look up the value of x. (Consider that x might not even exist at the point that abs(x) is called.) Only then can the absolute value calculation happen. For the multiplication, Python needs to lookup the version of * that can be used, depending on the type of x.\nLet’s consider writing a loop with some ridiculous code:\n\nx = np.random.normal(10)\nfor i in range(10):\n    if np.random.normal(size = 1) &gt; 0:\n        x = 'hi'\n    if np.random.normal(size = 1) &gt; 0.5:\n        del x\n    x[i]= np.exp(x[i])\n\nThere is no way around the fact that because of how dynamic this is, the interpreter needs to check if x exists, if it is an array of sufficient length, if it contains numeric values, and it needs to go retrieve the required value, EVERY TIME the np.exp() is executed. Now the code above is unusual, and in most cases, we wouldn’t have the if statements that modify x. So you could imagine a process by which the checking were done on the first iteration and then not needed after that – that gets into the idea of just-in-time compilation, discussed later.\nThe standard Python interpreter (CPython) is a C function so in some sense everything that happens is running as compiled code, but there are lots more things being done to accomplish a given task using interpreted code than if the task had been written directly in code that is compiled. By analogy, consider talking directly to a person in a language you both know compared to talking to a person via an interpreter who has to translate between two languages. Ultimately, the same information gets communicated (hopefully!) but the number of words spoken and time involved is much greater.\nWhen running more complicated functions, there is often a lot of checking that is part of the function itself. For example scipy’s solve_triangular function ultimately calls out to the trtrs Lapack function, but before doing so, there is a lot of checking that can take time. To that point, the documentation suggests you might set check_finite=False to improve performance at the expense of potential problems if the input matrices contain troublesome elements.\nWe can flip the question on its head and ask what operations in an interpreted language will execute quickly. In Python, these include:\n\noperations that call out to compiled C code,\nlinear algebra operations (these call out to compiled C or Fortran code provided by the BLAS and LAPACK software packages), and\nvectorized calls rather than loops:\n\nvectorized calls generally run loops in compiled C code rather than having the loop run in Python, and\nthat means that the interpreter doesn’t have to do all the checking discussed above for every iteration of the loop.\n\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\nOverview\nCompilation is the process of turning code in a given language (such a C++) into machine code. Machine code is the code that the processor actually executes. The machine code is stored in the executable file, which is a binary file. The history of programming has seen ever great levels of abstraction, so that humans can write code using syntax that is easier for us to understand, re-use, and develop building blocks that can be put together to do complicated tasks. For example assembly language is a step above machine code. Languages like C and Fortran provide additional abstraction beyond that. The Statistics 750 class at CMU has a nice overview if you want to see more details.\nNote that interpreters such as Python are themselves programs – the standard Python interpreter (CPython) is a C program that has been compiled. It happens to be a program that processes Python code. The interpreter doesn’t turn Python code into machine code, but the interpreter itself is machine code.\n\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) compilation\nStandard compilation (ahead-of-time or AOT compilation) happens before any code is executed and can involve a lot of optimization to produce the most efficient machine code possible.\nIn contrast, just-in-time (JIT) compilation happens at the time that the code is executing. JIT compilation is heavily used in Julia, which is very fast (in some cases as fast as C). JIT compilation involves translating to machine code as the code is running. One nice aspect is that the results are cached so that if code is rerun, the compilation process doesn’t have to be redone. So if you use a language like Julia, you’ll see that the speed can vary drastically between the first time and later times you run a given function during a given session.\nOne thing that needs to be dealt with is type checking. As discussed above, part of why an interpreter is slow is because the type of the variable(s) involved in execution of a piece of code is not known in advance, so the interpreter needs to check the type. In JIT systems, there are often type inference systems that determine variable types.\nJIT compilation can involve translation from the original code to machine code or translation of bytecode (see next section) to machine code.\nAt the end of this unit, we’ll see the use of JIT compilation with the JAX package in Python.\nnumba is a standard JIT compiler for Python and numpy that uses the LLVM compiler library. To use it one applies the numba.njit decorator to a Python function.\n\n\nByte compiling (optional)\nFunctions in Python and Python packages may byte compiled. What does that mean? Byte-compiled code is a special representation that can be executed more efficiently because it is in the form of compact codes that encode the results of parsing and semantic analysis of scoping and other complexities of the Python source code. This byte code can be executed faster than the original Python code because it skips the stage of having to be interpreted by the Python interpreter.\nIf you look at the file names in the directory of an installed Python package you may see files with the .pyc extension. These files have been byte-compiled.\nWe can byte compile our own functions using either the py_compile or compileall modules. Here’s an example (silly since as experienced Python programmers, we would use vectorized calculation here rather than this unvectorized code.)\n\nimport time\n\ndef f(vals):\n    x = np.zeros(len(vals))\n    for i in range(len(vals)):\n        x[i] = np.exp(vals[i])\n    return x\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**6)\nt0 = time.time()\nout = f(x)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.7561802864074707\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout = np.exp(x)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.013027191162109375\n\nimport py_compile\npy_compile.compile('vec.py')\n\n'__pycache__/vec.cpython-312.pyc'\n\ncp __pycache__/vec.cpython-312.pyc vec.pyc\nrm vec.py    # Make sure non-compiled module not loaded.\n\n\nimport vec\nvec.__file__\n\n'/accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units/vec.pyc'\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout = vec.f(x)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.7301280498504639\nUnfortunately, as seen above byte compiling may not speed things up much. I’m not sure why.",

    "text": "Benchmarking and profiling\nRecall that it’s a waste of time to optimize code before you determine (1) that the code is too slow for how it will be used and (2) which are the slow steps on which to focus your attempts to speed the code up. A 100x speedup in a step that takes 1% of the time will speed up the overall code by essentially nothing.\n\nTiming your code\nThere are a few ways to time code:\n\nimport time\nx = np.random.normal(size = 10**7)\nt0 = time.time()\ny = np.exp(x)\nt1 = time.time()\n\nprint(f\"Execution time: {t1-t0} seconds.\")\n\nExecution time: 0.07335495948791504 seconds.\n\n\nIn general, it’s a good idea to repeat (replicate) your timing, as there is some stochasticity in how fast your computer will run a piece of code at any given moment.\n\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\ny = np.exp(3.)\nt1 = time.time()\n\nprint(f\"Execution time: {t1-t0} seconds.\")\n\nExecution time: 0.008359670639038086 seconds.\n\n\nUsing time is fine for code that takes a little while to run, but for code that is really fast (such as the code above), it may not be very accurate. Measuring fast bits of code is tricky to do well. This next approach is better for benchmarking code (particularly faster bits of code).\n\nimport timeit\n\ntimeit.timeit('x = np.exp(3.)', setup = 'import numpy as np', number = 100)\n\n0.0001526419073343277\n\ncode = '''\nx = np.exp(3.)\n'''\n\ntimeit.timeit(code, setup = 'import numpy as np', number = 100)\n\n0.00014456361532211304\n\n\nThat reports the total time for the 100 replications.\nWe can run it from the command line.\n\npython -m timeit -s 'import numpy' -n 1000 'x = numpy.exp(3.)'\n\n1000 loops, best of 5: 573 nsec per loop\n\n\ntimeit ran the code 1000 times for 5 different repetitions, giving the average time for the 1000 samples for the best of the 5 repetitions.\n\n\nProfiling\nThe Cprofile module will show you how much time is spent in different functions, which can help you pinpoint bottlenecks in your code.\nI haven’t run this code when producing this document as the output of the profiling can be lengthy.\n\ndef lr_slow(y, x):\n    xtx = x.T @ x\n    xty = x.T @ y\n    inv = np.linalg.inv(xtx)\n    return inv @ xty\n\n## generate random observations and random matrix of predictors\nn = 7000\ny = np.random.normal(size = 7000)\nx = np.random.normal(size = (7000,1000))\n\nt0 = time.time()\nregr = lr_slow(y, x)\nt1 = time.time()\nprint(f\"Execution time: {t1-t0} seconds.\")\n\nimport cProfile\ncProfile.run('lr_slow(y,x)')\n\nThe cumtime column includes the time spent in nested calls to functions while the tottime column excludes it.\nAs we’ll discuss in detail in Unit 10, we almost never want to explicitly invert a matrix. Instead we factorize the matrix and use the factorized result to do the computation of interest. In this case using the Cholesky decomposition is a standard approach, followed by solving triangular systems of equations.\n\nimport scipy as sp\n\ndef lr_fast(y, x):\n    xtx = x.T @ x\n    xty = x.T @ y\n    L = sp.linalg.cholesky(xtx)\n    out = sp.linalg.solve_triangular(L.T, \n          sp.linalg.solve_triangular(L, xty, lower=True),\n          lower=False)\n    return out\n\nt0 = time.time()\nregr = lr_fast(y, x)\nt1 = time.time()\nprint(f\"Execution time: {t1-t0} seconds.\")\n\ncProfile.run('lr_fast(y,x)')\n\nIn principle, the Cholesky now dominates the computational time (but is much faster than inv), so there’s not much more we can do in this case. That said, it’s not obvious from the profiling that the fact that most of the time is in the Cholesky is the case. Interpreting the output of a profiler can be hard. In this case to investigate further I would probably time individual steps with timeit.\nYou might wonder if it’s better to use x.T or np.transpose(x). Try using timeit to decide.\nThe Python profilers (cProfile and profile (not shown)) use deterministic profiling – calculating the interval between events (i.e., function calls and returns). However, there is some limit to accuracy – the underlying ‘clock’ measures in units of about 0.001 seconds.\n(In contrast, R’s profiler works by sampling (statistical profiling) - every little while during a calculation it finds out what function R is in and saves that information to a file. So if you try to profile code that finishes really quickly, there’s not enough opportunity for the sampling to represent the calculation accurately and you may get spurious results.)",

    "text": "Writing efficient (Python) code\nWe’ll discuss a variety of these strategies, including:\n\nPre-allocating memory rather than growing objects iteratively\nVectorization and use of fast matrix algebra\nConsideration of loops vs. map operations\nSpeed of lookup operations, including hashing\n\nWhile illustrated in Python, many of the underlying ideas pertain in other contexts.\n\nPre-allocating memory\nLet’s consider whether we should pre-allocate space for the output of an operation or if it’s ok to keep extending the length of an array or list.\n\nn = 100000\nz = np.random.normal(size = n)\n\n## Pre-allocation\n\ndef fun_prealloc(vals):\n   n = len(vals)\n   x = [0] * n\n   for i in range(n):\n       x[i] = np.exp(vals[i])\n   return x\n\n## Appending to a list\n\ndef fun_append(vals):\n   x = []\n   for i in range(n):\n       x.append(np.exp(vals[i]))\n   return x\n\n## Appending to a numpy array\n\ndef fun_append_np(vals):\n   x = np.array([])\n   for i in range(n):\n       x = np.append(x, np.exp(vals[i]))\n   return x\n\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout1 = fun_prealloc(z)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.1248617172241211\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout2 = fun_append(z)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.13328289985656738\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout3 = fun_append_np(z)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n2.8459062576293945\n\n\nSo what’s going on? First let’s consider what is happening with the use of np.append. Note that it is a function, rather than a method, and we need to reassign to x. What must be happening in terms of memory use and copying when we append an element?\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = 5)\nid(x)\n\n140216979394544\n\nid(np.append(x, 3.34))\n\n140216979394448\n\n\nWe can avoid that large cost of copying and memory allocation by pre-allocating space for the entire output array. (This is equivalent to variable initialization in compiled languages.)\nOk, but how is it that we can append to the list at apparently no cost?\nIt’s not magic, just that Python is clever. Let’s get an idea of what is going on:\n\ndef fun_append2(vals):\n   n = len(vals)\n   x = []\n   print(f\"Initial id: {id(x)}\")\n   sz = sys.getsizeof(x)\n   print(f\"iteration 0: size {sz}\")\n   for i in range(n):\n       x.append(np.exp(vals[i]))\n       if sys.getsizeof(x) != sz:\n           sz = sys.getsizeof(x)\n           print(f\"iteration {i}: size {sz}\")\n   print(f\"Final id: {id(x)}\")\n   return x\n\nz = np.random.normal(size = 1000)\nout = fun_append2(z)\n\nInitial id: 140216977543424\niteration 0: size 56\niteration 0: size 88\niteration 4: size 120\niteration 8: size 184\niteration 16: size 248\niteration 24: size 312\niteration 32: size 376\niteration 40: size 472\niteration 52: size 568\niteration 64: size 664\niteration 76: size 792\niteration 92: size 920\niteration 108: size 1080\niteration 128: size 1240\niteration 148: size 1432\niteration 172: size 1656\niteration 200: size 1912\niteration 232: size 2200\niteration 268: size 2520\niteration 308: size 2872\niteration 352: size 3256\niteration 400: size 3704\niteration 456: size 4216\niteration 520: size 4792\niteration 592: size 5432\niteration 672: size 6136\niteration 760: size 6936\niteration 860: size 7832\niteration 972: size 8856\nFinal id: 140216977543424\n\n\nSurprisingly, the id of x doesn’t seem to change, even though we are allocating new memory at many of the iterations. What is happening is that x is a wrapper object that contains within it a reference to an array of references (pointers) to the list elements. The location of the wrapper object doesn’t change, but the underlying array of references/pointers is being reallocated.\nSide note: I don’t know of any way to find out the location of the underlying array of pointers. I believe that under the hood, Python uses the realloc system call to request memory from the operating system when it needs to use additional pointers, and that the operating system can then try to allocate the additional memory at the same location (i.e., extending the block of memory).\nNote that as we discussed in the previous section on memory use, our assessment of size above does not include the actual size of the list elements, as illustrated by having one element of the list be a big object:\n\nprint(sys.getsizeof(out))\n\n8856\n\nout[2] = np.random.normal(size = 100000)\nprint(sys.getsizeof(out))\n\n8856\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrow objects using lists, then convert\n\n\n\nOne upshot of how Python efficiently grows lists is that if you need to grow an object, use a Python list. Then once it is complete, you can always convert it to another type, such as a numpy array.\n\n\n\n\nVectorization and use of fast matrix algebra\nOne key way to write efficient Python code is to take advantage of numpy’s vectorized operations.\n\nn = 10**6\nz = np.random.normal(size = n)\nt0 = time.time()\nx = np.exp(z)\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.014235258102416992\n\nx = np.zeros(n)  # Leave out pre-allocation timing to focus on computation.\nt0 = time.time()\nfor i in range(n):\n    x[i] = np.exp(z[i])\n\n\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.8167824745178223\n\n\nSo what is different in how Python handles the calculations above that explains the huge disparity in efficiency? The vectorized calculation is being done natively in C in a for loop. The explicit Python for loop involves executing the for loop in Python with repeated calls to C code at each iteration. This involves a lot of overhead because of the repeated processing of the Python code inside the loop. For example, in each iteration of the loop, Python is checking the types of the variables because it’s possible that the types might change, as discussed earlier.\nYou can usually get a sense for how quickly a Python call will pass things along to C or Fortran by looking at the body of the relevant function(s) being called.\nUnfortunately seeing the source code in Python often involves going and finding it in a file on disk, whereas in R, printing a function will show its source code. However you can use ?? in IPython to get the code for non-builtin functions. Consider numpy.linspace??.\nHere I found the source code for the scipy triangular_solve function, which calls out to a Fortran function trtrs, found in the LAPACK library.\n\n## On an SCF machine:\n/usr/local/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/scipy/linalg/_basic.py\n\nWith a bit more digging around we could verify that trtrs is a LAPACK funcion by doing some grepping:\n./linalg/_basic.py:    trtrs, = get_lapack_funcs(('trtrs',), (a1, b1))\nMany numpy and scipy functions allow you to pass in arrays, and operate on those arrays in vectorized fashion. So before writing a for loop, look at the help information on the relevant function(s) to see if they operate in a vectorized fashion. Functions might take arrays for one or more of their arguments.\nOutside of the numerical packages, we often have to manually do the looping:\n\nx = [3.5, 2.7, 4.6]\ntry:\n    math.cos(x)\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\nmust be real number, not list\n\n[math.cos(val) for val in x]\n\n[-0.9364566872907963, -0.9040721420170612, -0.11215252693505487]\n\nlist(map(math.cos, x))\n\n[-0.9364566872907963, -0.9040721420170612, -0.11215252693505487]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nConsider the chi-squared statistic involved in a test of independence in a contingency table:\n\\[\n\\chi^{2}=\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\frac{(y_{ij}-e_{ij})^{2}}{e_{ij}},\\,\\,\\,\\, e_{ij}=\\frac{y_{i\\cdot}y_{\\cdot j}}{y_{\\cdot\\cdot}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_{i\\cdot}=\\sum_{j}y_{ij}\\) and \\(y_{\\cdot j} = \\sum_{i} y_{ij}\\) and \\(y_{\\cdot\\cdot} = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} y_{ij}\\). Write this in a vectorized way without any loops. Note that ‘vectorized’ calculations also work with matrices and arrays.\n\n\nSometimes we can exploit vectorized mathematical operations in surprising ways, though sometimes the code is uglier.\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = n)\n\n## List comprehension\ntimeit.timeit('truncx = [max(0,val) for val in x]', number = 10, globals = {'x':x})\n\n1.8440100383013487\n\n\n\n## Vectorized slice replacement\ntimeit.timeit('truncx = x.copy(); truncx[x &lt; 0] = 0', number = 10, globals = {'x':x})\n\n0.06943236477673054\n\n\n\n## Vectorized math trick\ntimeit.timeit('truncx = x * x&gt;0', number = 10, globals = {'x':x})\n\n0.017205309122800827\n\n\nWe’ll discuss what has to happen (in terms of calculations, memory allocation, and copying) in the two vectorized approaches to try to understand which is more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional efficiency tips\n\n\n\n\nIf you do need to loop over dimensions of a matrix or array, if possible loop over the smallest dimension and use the vectorized calculation on the larger dimension(s). For example if you have a 10000 by 10 matrix, try to set up your problem so you can loop over the 10 columns rather than the 10000 rows.\nIn general, in Python looping over rows is likely to be faster than looping over columns because of numpy’s row-major ordering (by default, matrices are stored in memory as a long array in which values in a row are adjacent to each other). However how numpy handles this is more complicated (see more in the Section on cache-aware programming), such that it may not matter for numpy calculations.\nYou can use direct arithmetic operations to add/subtract/multiply/divide a 1-d array by each column of a matrix, e.g. A*b does element-wise multiplication of each row of A by a 1-d array b. If you need to operate by column, you can do it by transposing the matrix.\n\n\n\nCaution: relying on Python’s broadcasting rule in the context of vectorized operations, such as is done when direct-multiplying a matrix by a 1-d array to scale the columns relative to each other, can be dangerous as the code may not be easy for someone to read and poses greater dangers of bugs. In some cases you may want to first write the code more directly and then compare the more efficient code to make sure the results are the same. It’s also a good idea to comment your code in such cases.\n\n\nVectorization, mapping, and loops\nNext let’s consider when loops and mapping would be particularly slow and how mapping and loops might compare to each other.\nFirst, the potential for inefficiency of looping and map operations in interpreted languages will depend in part on whether a substantial part of the work is in the overhead involved in the looping or in the time required by the function evaluation on each of the elements.\nHere’s an example, where the core computation is very fast, so we might expect the overhead of looping (in its various forms seen here) to be important.\n\nimport time\nn = 10**6\nx = np.random.normal(size = n)\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout = np.exp(x)\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.013351202011108398\n\nt0 = time.time()\nvals = np.zeros(n)\nfor i in range(n):\n    vals[i] = np.exp(x[i])\n\n\ntime.time() - t0\n\n1.2585413455963135\n\nt0 = time.time()\nvals = [np.exp(v) for v in x]\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.872887372970581\n\nt0 = time.time()\nvals = list(map(np.exp, x))\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.9198911190032959\n\n\nRegardless of how we do the looping (an explicit loop, list comprehension, or map), it looks like we can’t avoid the overhead unless we use the vectorized call, which is of course the recommended approach in this case, both for speed and readability (and conciseness).\nSecond, is it faster to use map than to use a loop? In the example above it is somewhat (but not substantially) faster to use map (and still much slower than vectorization). In the loop case, the interpreter needs to do the checking we discussed earlier in this section at each iteration of the loop. What about in the map case? For mapping over a numpy array, perhaps not, but what if mapping over a list? Without digging into how map works, it’s hard to say, but it does seem that based on this example, map is not doing anything special that saves much time when mapping over the elements of a numpy array.\nHere’s an example where the bulk of time is in the actual computation and not in the looping itself. We’ll run a bunch of regressions on a matrix X (i.e., each column of X is a predictor) using each column of the matrix mat to do a separate regression.\n\nimport time\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nn = 500000;\nnr = 10000\nnCalcs = int(n/nr)\n\nmat = np.random.normal(size = (nr, nCalcs))\n\nX = list(range(nr))\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\ndef regrFun(i):\n    model = sm.OLS(mat[:,i], X)\n    return model.fit().params[1]\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout1 = list(map(regrFun, range(nCalcs)))\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.06260561943054199\n\nt0 = time.time()\nout2 = np.zeros(nCalcs)\nfor i in range(nCalcs):\n    out2[i] = regrFun(i)\n\n\ntime.time() - t0\n\n0.062422990798950195\n\n\nHere they’re about the same time (depending on when I render the document, I am getting some stochasticity in the timing). This is not too surprising – the overhead of the iteration should be small relative to the fundamental cost of the model fitting, and we wouldn’t be concerned with the overhead of using a loop.\n\n\nMatrix algebra efficiency\nOften calculations that are not explicitly linear algebra calculations can be done as matrix algebra. If our Python installation has a fast (and possibly parallelized) BLAS, this allows our calculation to take advantage of it.\nFor example, we can sum the rows of a matrix by multiplying by a 1-d array of ones.\n\nmat = np.random.normal(size=(500,500))\n\ntimeit.timeit('mat.dot(np.ones(500))', setup = 'import numpy as np',\n              number = 1000, globals = {'mat': mat})\n\n0.055118825286626816\n\ntimeit.timeit('np.sum(mat, axis = 1)', setup = 'import numpy as np',\n              number = 1000, globals = {'mat': mat})\n\n0.14957964792847633\n\n\nGiven the extra computation involved in actually multiplying each number by one, it’s surprising that this is faster than numpy sum function. One thing we’d want to know is whether the BLAS matrix multiplication call is being done in parallel.\nOn the other hand, big matrix operations can be slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nSuppose you want a new matrix that computes the differences between successive columns of a matrix of arbitrary size. How would you do this as matrix algebra operations? It’s possible to write it as multiplying the matrix by another matrix that contains 0s, 1s, and -1s in appropriate places. Here it turns out that the for loop is much faster than matrix multiplication. However, there is a way to do it faster as matrix direct subtraction.\n\n\n\n\nOrder of operations and efficiency\nWhen doing matrix algebra, the order in which you do operations can be critical for efficiency. How should I order the following calculation?\n\nn = 5000\nA = np.random.normal(size=(n, n))\nB = np.random.normal(size=(n, n))\nx = np.random.normal(size=n)\n\nt0 = time.time()\nres1 = (A @ B) @ x\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n2.1078994274139404\n\nt0 = time.time()\nres1 = A @ (B @ x)\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.0403590202331543\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nWhy is the second order much faster?\nCount the number of multiplications involved in each of the two approaches.\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding unnecessary operations\nWe can use the matrix direct product (i.e., A*B) to do some manipulations much more quickly than using matrix multiplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nHow can I use the direct product to find the trace of a matrix, \\(XY\\)?\n\n\nWhen working with diagonal matrices, you can generally get much faster results by being smart. The following operations: \\(X+D\\), \\(DX\\), \\(XD\\) are mathematically the sum of two matrices and products of two matrices. But we can do the computation without using two full matrices.\n\nn = 1000\nX = np.random.normal(size=(n, n))\ndiagvals = np.random.normal(size=n)\nD = np.diag(diagvals)\n\n# The following lines are very inefficient\nsummedMat = X + D\nprodMat1 = D @ X\nprodMat2 = X @ D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nConsider either \\(X+D\\), \\(DX\\), or \\(XD\\). How can I use vectorization to do this much more quickly than the direct, naive translation of the math into code?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploit sparsity/structure!\n\n\n\nMore generally, sparse matrices and structured matrices (such as block diagonal matrices) can generally be worked with MUCH more efficiently than treating them as arbitrary matrices. The scipy.sparse package (for both structured and arbitrary sparse matrices) can help, as can specialized code available in other languages, such as C and Fortran packages.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed of lookup operations\nThere are lots of situations in which we need to retrieve values for subsequent computations. In some cases we might be retrieving elements of an array or looking up values in a dictionary.\nLet’s compare the speed of some different approaches to lookup.\n\nn = 1000\nx = list(np.random.normal(size = n))\nlabels = [str(v) for v in range(n)]\nxD = dict(zip(labels, x))\n\ntimeit.timeit(\"x[500]\", number = 10**6, globals = {'x':x})\n\n0.01837697997689247\n\ntimeit.timeit(\"xD['500']\", number=10**6, globals = {'xD':xD})\n\n0.02649267017841339\n\n\nHow is it that Python can look up by key in the dictionary at essentially the same speed as jumping to an index position? It uses hashing, which allows O(1) lookup. In contrast, if one has to look through each label (key) in turn, that is O(n), which is much slower:\n\ntimeit.timeit(\"x[labels.index('500')]\", number = 10**6, globals = {'x':x, 'labels': labels})\n\n8.889075418934226\n\n\nAs a further point of contrast, if we look up elements by name in R in named vectors or lists, that is much slower than looking up by index, because R doesn’t use hashing in that context and has to scan through the objects one by one until it finds the one with the name it is looking for. This stands in contrast to R and Python being able to directly go to the position of interest based on the index of an array, or to the hash-based lookup in a Python dictionary or an R environment.\n\n\nHashing (including name lookup)\nAbove I mentioned that Python uses hashing to store and lookup values by key in a dictionary. I’ll briefly describe what hashing is here, because it is a commonly-used strategy in programming in general.\nA hash function is a function that takes as input some data (some input abitrary length) and maps it to a fixed-length output that can be used as a shortened reference to the data. (The function should be deterministic, always returing the same output for a given input.) We’ve seen this in the context of git commits where each commit was labeled with a long base-16 number. This also comes up when verifying files on the Internet. You can compute the hash value on the file you get and check that it is the same as the hash value associated with the legitimate copy of the file. Even small changes in the file will result in a different hash value.\nWhile there are various uses of hashing, for our purposes here, hashing can allow one to look up values by their name via a hash table. The idea is that you have a set of key-value pairs (sometimes called a dictionary) where the key is the name associated with the value and the value is some arbitrary object. You want to be able to quickly find the value/object quickly.\nHashing allows one to quickly determine an index associated with the key and therefore quickly find the relevant value based on the index. For example, one approach is to compute the hash as a function of the key and then take the remainder when dividing by the number of possible results (here the fact that the result is a fixed-length output is important) to get the index. Here’s the procedure in pseudocode:\n    hash = hashfunc(key) \n    index = hash %% array_size \n    ## %% is modulo operator - it gives the remainder\nIn general, there will be collisions – multiple keys will be assigned to the same index (this is unavoidable because of the fact that the hash function returns a fixed length output). However with a good hash function, usually there will be a small number of keys associated with a given bucket. So each bucket will contain a list of a small number of values and the associated keys. (The buckets might contain the actual values or they might contain the addresses of where the values are actually stored if the values are complicated objects.) Then determining the correct value (or the required address) within a given bucket is fast even with simple linear search through the items one by one. Put another way, the hash function distributes the keys amongst an array of buckets and allows one to look up the appropriate bucket quickly based on the computed index value. When the hash table is properly set up, the cost of looking up a value does not depend on the number of key-value pairs stored.\nPython uses hashing to look up the value based on the key in a given dictionary, and similarly when looking up variables in namespaces. This allows Python to retrieve objects very quickly.",

    "text": "Additional general strategies for efficiency\nIt’s also useful to be aware of some other strategies for improving efficiency.\n\nCache-aware programming\nIn addition to main memory (what we usually mean when we talk about RAM), computers also have memory caches, which are small amounts of fast memory that can be accessed very quickly by the processor. For example your computer might have L1, L2, and L3 caches, with L1 the smallest and fastest and L3 the largest and slowest. The idea is to try to have the data that is most used by the processor in the cache.\nIf the next piece of data needed for computation is available in the cache, this is a cache hit and the data can be accessed very quickly. However, if the data is not available in the cache, this is a cache miss and the speed of access will be a lot slower. Cache-aware programming involves writing your code to minimize cache misses. Generally when data is read from memory it will be read in chunks, so values that are contiguous will be read together.\nHow does this inform one’s programming? For example, if you have a matrix of values stored in row-major order, computing on a row will be a lot faster than computing on a column, because the row can be read into the cache from main memory and then accessed in the cache. In contrast, if the matrix is large and therefore won’t fit in the cache, when you access the values of a column, you’ll have to go to main memory repeatedly to get the values for the row because the values are not stored contiguously.\nThere’s a nice example of the importance of the cache at the bottom of this blog post.\nIf you know the size of the cache, you can try to design your code so that in a given part of your code you access data structures that will fit in the cache. This sort of thing is generally more relevant if you’re coding in a language like C. But it can matter sometimes in interpreted languages too.\nLet’s see what happens in Python. By default, matrices in numpy are row-major, also called “C order”. I’ll create a long matrix with a small number of very long columns and a wide matrix with a small number of very long rows.\n\nnr = 800000\nnc = 100\n\nA = np.random.normal(size=(nr, nc))   # long matrix\ntA = np.random.normal(size=(nc, nr))  # wide matrix\n\n## Verify that A is row-major using `.flags` (notice the `C_CONTIGUOUS: True`).\nA.flags\n\n  C_CONTIGUOUS : True\n  F_CONTIGUOUS : False\n  OWNDATA : True\n  WRITEABLE : True\n  ALIGNED : True\n  WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False\n\n\nNote that I didn’t use A.T or np.transpose as that doesn’t make a copy in memory and so the transposed matrix doesn’t end up being row-major. You can use A.flags and A.T.flags` to see this.\nNow let’s time calculating the sum by column in the long matrix vs. the sum by row in the wide matrix. Exactly the same number of arithmetic operations needs to be done in an equivalent manner for the two cases. We want to use a large enough matrix so the entire matrix doesn’t fit in the cache, but not so large that the example takes a long time or a huge amount of memory. We’ll use a rectangular matrix, such that the summation for a single column of the long matrix or a single row of the wide matrix involves many numbers, but there are a limited number of such summations. This focuses the example on the efficiency of the column-wise vs. row-wise summation rather than any issues that might be involved in managing large numbers of such summations (e.g., doing many, many summations that involve just a few numbers).\n\n# Define the sum calculations as functions\ndef sum_by_row():\n    return np.sum(tA, axis=1)\n\ndef sum_by_column():\n    return np.sum(A, axis=0)\n\ntimeit.timeit(sum_by_row, number=10)\n\n0.4247714728116989\n\ntimeit.timeit(sum_by_column, number=10)  # potentially slow\n\n0.4746148604899645\n\n\nSuppose we instead do the looping manually.\n\ntimeit.timeit('[np.sum(A[:,col]) for col in range(A.shape[1])]',\n    setup = 'import numpy as np', number=10, globals = {'A': A})   \n\n5.474395116791129\n\ntimeit.timeit('[np.sum(tA[row,:]) for row in range(tA.shape[0])]',\n    setup = 'import numpy as np', number=10, globals = {'tA': tA})  \n\n0.4419558625668287\n\n\nIndeed, the row-wise calculations are much faster when done manually. However, when done with the axis argument in np.sum there is little difference. So that suggests numpy might be doing something clever in its implementation of sum with the axis argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nSuppose you were writing code for this kind of use case. How could you set up your calculations to do either row-wise or column-wise operations in a way that processes each number sequentially based on the order in which the numbers are stored? For example suppose the values are stored row-major but you want the column sums.\n\n\nWhen we define a numpy array, we can choose to use column-major order (i.e., “Fortran” order) with the order argument.\n\n\nLoop fusion\nLet’s consider this (vectorized) code:\n\nx = np.exp(x) + 3*np.sin(x)\n\nThis code has some downsides.\n\nThink about whether any additional memory has to be allocated.\nThink about how many for loops will have to get executed.\n\nContrast that to running directly as a for loop (e.g., here in Julia or in C/C++):\n\nfor i in 1:length(x)\n    x[i] = exp(x[i]) + 3*sin(x[i])\nend\n\nHow does that affect the downsides mentioned above?\nCombining loops is called ‘fusing’ and is an important optimization that Julia can do, as shown in this demo. It’s also a key optimization done by XLA, a compiler used with JAX and Tensorflow, so one approach to getting loop fusion in Python is to use JAX (or Tensorflow) for such calculations within Python rather than simply using numpy.\n\n\nJIT compilation (with JAX)\nYou can think of JAX as a version of numpy enabled to use the GPU (or automatically parallelize on CPU threads) and provide automatic differentiation.\nWe can also JIT compile JAX code. Behind the scenes, the instructions are compiled to machine code for different backends (e.g., CPU and GPU) using the XLA compiler.\nLet’s first consider running a vectorized calculation using JAX on the CPU, which will use multiple threads (discussed in Unit 6), each thread running on a separate CPU core on our computer. For now all we need to know is that the calculation will run in parallel, so we expect it to be faster than when using numpy, which won’t run the calculation in parallel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis demo uses 4 GB of memory just for x. Run on your own machine with caution.\n\n\n\nimport time\nimport numpy as np\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef myfun_np(x):\n    y = np.exp(x) + 3 * np.sin(x)\n    return y\n    \ndef myfun_jnp(x):\n    y = jnp.exp(x) + 3 * jnp.sin(x)\n    return y\n\nn = 500000000\n\nx = np.random.normal(size = n).astype(np.float32)  # 32-bit for consistency with JAX default\nx_jax = jnp.array(x)  # 32-bit by default\nprint(x_jax.platform())\n\ncpu\n\nt0 = time.time()\nz = myfun_np(x)\nt1 = time.time() - t0\n\nt0 = time.time()\nz_jax = myfun_jnp(x_jax).block_until_ready()\nt2 = time.time() - t0\n\nprint(f\"numpy time: {round(t1,3)}\\njax time: {round(t2,3)}\")\n\nRunning on the SCF gandalf machine (not shown above), we get these times.\nnumpy time: 17.181\njax time: 5.722\nThere’s a nice speedup compared to numpy.\nSince JAX will often execute computations asynchronously (in particular when using the GPU), the block_until_ready invocation ensures that the computation finishes before we stop timing.\nBy default the JAX floating point type is 32-bit so we forced the use of 32-bit numbers for numpy for comparability. One could have JAX use 64-bit numbers like this:\n\nimport jax\njax.config.update(\"jax_enable_x64\", True)  \n\nNext let’s consider JIT compiling it, which should fuse the vectorized operations and avoid temporary objects. The JAX docs have a nice discussion of when JIT compilation will be beneficial.\n\nimport jax\nmyfun_jnp_jit = jax.jit(myfun_jnp)\n\nt0 = time.time()\nz_jax_jit = myfun_jnp_jit(x_jax).block_until_ready()\nt3 = time.time() - t0\nprint(f\"jitted jax time: {round(t3,3)}\")\n\njitted jax time: 3.218\nSo that gives a nice two-fold additional speedup.\n\n\nLazy evaluation\nWhat’s strange about this R code?\n\nf &lt;- function(x) print(\"hi\")\nsystem.time(mean(rnorm(1000000)))\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  0.062   0.000   0.062 \n\nsystem.time(f(3))\n\n[1] \"hi\"\n\n\n   user  system elapsed \n      0       0       0 \n\nsystem.time(f(mean(rnorm(1000000)))) \n\n[1] \"hi\"\n\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  0.001   0.000   0.001 \n\n\nIt seems like the rnorm(1000000) is not actually executed when being passed to f. That is “lazy evaluation” in action - the code that is passed in as an argument is only evaluated when it is needed (and in this case it’s not needed for the function to run).\nLazy evaluation is not just an R thing. It also occurs in Tensorflow (particularly version 1), the Python Dask package, and in Spark. The basic idea is to delay executation until it’s really needed, with the goal that if one does so, the system may be able to better optimize a series of multiple steps as a joint operation relative to executing them one by one.\nHowever, Python itself does not have lazy evaluation.",

For non-public items, a comment after the def line is sufficient to describe the purpose of the item.\nIndentation: Python is strict about indentation of course, which helps to enforce clear indentation more than in other languages. This helps you and others to read and understand the code and can help in detecting errors in your code because it can expose lack of symmetry.\n\nuse 4 spaces per indentation level (avoid tabs if possible).\n\nWhitespace: use it in a variety of places. Some places where it is good to have it are\n\naround operators (assignment and arithmetic);\nbetween function arguments;\nbetween list/tuple elements; and\nbetween matrix/array indices.\n\nUse blank lines to separate blocks of code with comments to say what the block does.\nUse whitespaces or parentheses for clarity even if not needed for order of operations.

Instead, use a/y * x.\nAvoid code lines longer than 79 characters and comment/docstring lines longer than 72 characters.\nComments: add helpful comments (but don’t belabor the obvious, such as x = x + 1  # increment x).\n\nRemember that in a few months, you may not follow your own code any better than a stranger.\nSome key things to document: (1) summarizing a block of code, (2) explaining a very complicated piece of code - recall our complicated regular expressions, and (3) explaining arbitrary constant values.\nComments should generally be complete sentences.\n\nYou can use parentheses to group operations such that they can be split up into lines and easily commented, e.g.,\n\nnewdf = (\n        pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n        .rename(columns = {'STATE': 'us_state'})  # adjust column names\n        .dropna()                                 # remove some rows\n        )\n\nFor software development, break code into separate files (2000-3000 lines per file) with meaningful file names and related functions grouped within a file.\nBeing consistent about the naming style for objects and functions is hard, but try to be consistent. PEP8 suggests:\n\nClass names should be UpperCamelCase.\nFunction, method, and variable names should be snake_case, e.g., number_of_its or n_its.\nNon-public methods and variables should have a leading underscore.\n\nTry to have the names be informative without being overly long.\nDon’t overwrite names of objects/functions that already exist in Python. E.g., don’t use len. That said, the namespace system helps with the unavoidable cases where there are name conflicts.\nUse active names for functions (e.g., calc_loglik, calc_log_lik rather than loglik or loglik_calc). The idea is that a function in a programming language is like a verb in regular language (a function does something), so use a verb to name it.\nLearn from others’ code\n\nThis semester, someone will be reading your code - the GSI and and me when we look at your assignments. So to help us in understanding your code and develop good habits, put these ideas into practice in your assignments.\nWhile not Python examples, the files goodCode.R and badCode.R in the units directory of the class repository provide examples of R code written such that it does and does not conform to the general ideas listed above (leaving aside the different syntax of Python and R).\n\n\nCoding style suggestions\nThis is particularly focused on software development, but some of the ideas are useful for data analysis as well.\n\nBreak down tasks into core units.\nWrite reusable code for core functionality and keep a single copy of the code (using version control) so you only need to make changes to a piece of code in one place.\nSmaller functions are easier to debug, easier to understand, and can be combined in a modular fashion (like the UNIX utilities).\nWrite functions that take data as an argument and not lines of code that operate on specific data objects. Why? Functions allow us to reuse blocks of code easily for later use and for recreating an analysis (reproducible research). It’s more transparent than sourcing a file of code because the inputs and outputs are specified formally, so you don’t have to read through the code to figure out what it does.\nFunctions should:\n\nbe modular (having a single task);\nhave meaningful name; and\nhave a doc string describing their purpose, inputs and outputs.\n\nWrite tests for each function (i.e., unit tests).\nDon’t hard code numbers - use variables (e.g., number of iterations, parameter values in simulations), even if you don’t expect to change the value, as this makes the code more readable. For example, the speed of light is a constant in a scientific sense, but best to make it a variable in code: speed_of_light = 3e8.\nUse lists or tuples to keep disparate parts of related data together.\nPractice defensive programming (see also the discussion below on raising exceptions and assertions):\n\ncheck function inputs and warn users if the code will do something they might not expect or makes particular choices;\ncheck inputs to if:\n\nNote that in Python, an expression used as the condition of an if will be equivalent to True unless it is one of False, 0, None, or an empty list/tuple/string.\n\nprovide reasonable default arguments;\ndocument the range of valid inputs;\ncheck that the output produced is valid; and\nstop execution based on checks and give an informative error message.\n\nTry to avoid system-dependent code that only runs on a specific version of an OS or specific OS.\nLearn from others’ code.\nAsk others to review your code and help by reviewing other people’s code.\nConsider rewriting your code once you know all the settings and conditions; often analyses and projects meander as we do our work and the initial plan for the code no longer makes sense and the code is no longer designed specifically for the job being done.\n\n\n\nLinting\nLinting is the process of applying a tool to your code to enforce style.\nHere we’ll see how to use ruff. You might also consider black.\nWe’ll practice with ruff with a small module we’ll use next also for debugging.\nFirst, we check for and fix syntax errors.\nruff check test.py\nAll checks passed!\nThen we ask ruff to reformat to conform to standard style.\ncp test.py test-save.py   # Not required, just so we can see what `ruff` did.\nruff format test.py\n1 file reformatted\nLet’s see what changed:\ndiff test-save.py test.py\n1c1\n&lt; x=  7\n---\n&gt; x = 7\n3,5d2\n&lt; def myfun(x, y =0):\n&lt; # This is a toy function.\n&lt;       return x*y\n6a4,6\n&gt; def myfun(x, y=0):\n&gt;     # This is a toy function.\n&gt;     return x * y\nSo we see that ruff fixed spacing and properly indented the comment line.",

    "section": "Assertions, exceptions and testing",
    "text": "Assertions, exceptions and testing\nAssertions, exceptions and testing are critically important for writing robust code that is less likely to contain bugs.\n\nExceptions\nYou’ve probably already seen exceptions in action whenever you’ve done something in Python that causes an error to occur and an error message to be printed. Syntax errors are different from exceptions in that exceptions occur when the syntax is correct, but the execution of the code results in some sort of error (i.e., a run-time error).\nExceptions can be a valuable tool for making your code handle different modes of failure (missing file, URL unreachable, permission denied, invalid inputs, etc.). You use them when you are writing code that is supposed to perform a task (e.g., a function that does something with an input file) to indicate that the task failed and the reason for that failure (e.g., the file was not there in the first place). In such a case, you want your code to raise an exception and make the error message informative as possible, typically by handling the exception thrown by another function you call and augmenting the message. Another possibility is that your code detects a situation where you need to throw an exception (e.g., an invalid input to a function).\nThe other side of the coin happens when you want to write a piece of code that handles failure in a specific way, instead of simply giving up. For example, if you are writing a script that reads and downloads hundreds of URLs, you don’t want your program to stop when any of them fails to respond (or do you?). You might want to continue with the rest of the URLs, and write out the failed URLs in a secondary output file.\n\nUsing try-except to continue execution\nIf you want some code to continue running even when it encounters an error, you can use try-except. This would often be done in code where you were running some workflow, but can also be useful in functions that you write for general purpose use (e.g., code in a package you are writing).\nSuppose we have a loop and we want to run all the iterations even if the code for some iterations fail. We can embed the code that might fail in a try block and then in the except block, run code that will handle the situation when the error occurs.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    try:\n        &lt;some code that might fail&gt;\n        result[i] = &lt;actual result&gt;\n    except:\n        &lt;what to do if the code fails&gt;\n        result[i] = None   \n\n\n\nStrategies for invoking and handling errors\nHere we’ll address situations that might arise when you are developing code for general purpose use (e.g., writing functions in a package) and need that code to invoke an error under certain circumstances or deal gracefully with an error occurring in some code that you are calling.\nA basic situation is when you want to detect a situation where you need to invoke an error (i.e., “throw an exception”).\nWith raise you can invoke an exception. Suppose we need an input to be a positive number. We’ll use Python’s built-in ValueError, one of the various exception types that Python provides and that you could use. You can also create your own exceptions by subclassing one of Python’s existing exception classes. (We haven’t yet discussed classes and object-oriented programming, so don’t worry if you’re not sure about what that means.)\n\ndef myfun(val):\n    if val &lt;= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"`val` should be positive\")\n\nmyfun(-3)\n\nValueError: `val` should be positive\nNext let’s consider cases where your function runs some code that might return an error.\nWe’d often want to catch the error using try-except. In some cases we would want to notify the user and then continue (perhaps falling back to a different way to do things or returning None from our function) while in others we might want to provide a more informative error message than if we had just let the error occur, but still have the exception be raised.\nFirst let’s see the case of continuing execution.\n\nimport os\n\ndef myfun(filename):\n    try:\n        with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n            text = file.read()\n    except Exception as err:\n        print(f\"{err}\\nCheck that the file `{filename}` can be found \"\\\n              f\"in the current path: `{os.getcwd()}`.\")\n        return None\n\n    return(text.lower())\n\n\nmyfun('missing_file.txt')\n\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'missing_file.txt'\nCheck that the file `missing_file.txt` can be found in the current path: `/accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units`.\nFinally let’s see how we can intercept an error but then “re-raise” the error rather than continuing execution.\n\nimport requests\n\ndef myfun(url):\n    try:\n        requests.get(url)\n    except Exception as err:\n        print(f\"There was a problem accessing {url}. \"\\\n              f\"Perhaps it doesn't exist or the URL has a typo?\")\n        raise\n\nmyfun(\"http://missingurl.com\")\n\nThere was a problem accessing http://missingurl.com. Perhaps it doesn't exist or the URL has a typo?\n\nConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='missingurl.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f348db44590&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))\n\n\n\nAssertions\nAssertions are a quick way to raise a specific type of Exception (AssertionError). Assertions are useful for performing quick checks in your code that the state of the program is as you expect. They’re primarily intended for use during the development process to provide “sanity checks” that specific conditions are true, and there are ways to disable them when you are running your code for production purposes (to improve performance). A common use is for verifying preconditions and postconditions (especially preconditions). One would generally only expect such conditions not to be true if there is a bug in the code. Here’s an example of using the assert statement in Python, with a clear assertion message telling the developer what the problem is.\n\nnumber = -42\nassert number &gt; 0, f\"number greater than 0 expected, got: {number}\"\n## Produces this error:\n## Traceback (most recent call last):\n##   File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n## AssertionError: number greater than 0 expected, got: -42\n\nVarious operators/functions are commonly used in assertions, including\n\nassert x in y\nassert x not in y\nassert x is y\nassert x is not y\nassert isinstance(x, &lt;some_type&gt;)\nassert all(x)\nassert any(x)\n\nAssertions can also be quite useful in the context of data analysis pipelines for checking that the state of the analysis is as expected. E.g., at various points, you might check that the dimension of your data is as expected, check for missing or extreme/unexpected values, etc.\nNext we’ll see that assertions are a core part of setting up tests.\n\n\nTesting\nTesting is informally what you do after you write some code and want to check that it actually works. But when you are developing important code (e.g. functions that are going to be used by others) you typically want to encode your tests in code. There are many reasons to do that, including making sure that if anyone changes the code later on and breaks something, the test suite should immediately indicate that.\nSome people even advocate for writing a preliminary test suite before writing the code itself(!) as it can be a good way to organize work and track progress, as well as act as a secondary form of documentation for clarity. This can include tests that your code provides correct and useful errors when something goes wrong (so that means that a test might be to see if problematic input correctly produces an error). Unit tests are intended to test the behavior of small pieces (units) of code, generally individual functions. Unit tests naturally work well with the ideas above of writing small, modular functions. I recommend the pytest package, which is designed to make it easier to write sets of good tests.\nHere is an example of the contents of a test file, called test_dummy.py.\n\nimport pytest\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport dummy\n\ndef test_numeric():\n    assert dummy.add_one(3) == 4\n\n# This test will fail.\ndef test_numpy_array():\n    assert np.all(np.equal(dummy.add_one(np.array([3,4])), np.array([4,5])))\n\ndef test_bad_input():\n    with pytest.raises(TypeError):\n        dummy.add_one('hello')\n\ndef test_warning():\n    with pytest.warns(UserWarning, match='complex'):\n        dummy.add_one(1+3j)\n\nWe can then run the tests via pytest like this:\npytest mytestfile.py\n====================================== test session starts ======================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-8.1.1, pluggy-1.4.0\nrootdir: /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units\nplugins: anyio-4.3.0\ncollected 4 items                                                                               \n\ntest_dummy.py .F..

The most common kind of CI is automated testing - running your tests on your code when you make changes to the code. This enforces the discipline of running tests regularly and avoids the common problem that testing passes locally on your own machine, but fails for various reasons when done elsewhere.\nA standard way to do this is via GitHub Actions (GHA).\nTo set up a GitHub Actions workflow, one\n\nspecifies when the workflow will run (e.g., when a push or pull request is made, or only manually)\nprovides instructions for how to set up the environment for the workflow\nprovides the operations that the workflow should run.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a YAML file placed in the .github/workflows directory of the repository.\nWith GHA, you specify the operating system and then the steps to run in the YAML file. Some steps will customize the environment as the initial steps and then additional step(s) will run shell or other code to run your workflow. You use pre-specified operations (called actions) to do common things (such as checking out a GitHub repository and installing commonly used software).\nWhen triggered, GitHub will run the steps in a virtual machine, which is called the runner.\nHere’s an example YAML file for testing an example package called mytoy:\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - main\n\njobs:\n  CI:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    # Install package and dependencies\n    - name: Set up Python \n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: 3.12\n\n    - name: Install mytoy and pytest\n      run: |\n        pip install pytest\n        pip install --user .\n\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: |\n        cd mytoy\n        pytest\nYou’ll use GitHub Actions to automate testing during your projects. Unfortunately, GitHub Actions is not available via github.berkeley.edu so we can’t use it with your class repositories for your problem set work.",

    "text": "Basic debugging strategies\nHere we’ll discuss some basic strategies for finding and fixing bugs. Other useful locations for tips on debugging include:\n\nEfficient Debugging by Goldspink\nDebugging for Beginners by Brody\n\nRead and think about the error message (the traceback), starting from the bottom of the traceback. Sometimes it’s inscrutable, but often it just needs a bit of deciphering. Looking up a given error message by simply doing a web search with the exact message in double quotes can be a good strategy, or you could look specifically on Stack Overflow.\nBelow we’ll see how one can view the stack trace. Usually when an error occurs, it occurs in a function call that is nested in a series of function calls. This series of calls is the call stack and the traceback or stack trace shows that series of calls that led to the error. To debug, you’ll often need to focus on the function being executed at the time the error occurred (which will be at the top of the call stack but the bottom of the traceback) and the arguments passed into that function. However, if the error occurs in a function you didn’t write, the problem will often be with the arguments that your code provided at the last point in the call stack at which code that you wrote was run. Check the arguments that your code passed into that first function that is not a function of yours.\nWhen running code that produces multiple errors, fix errors from the top down - fix the first error that is reported, because later errors are often caused by the initial error. It’s common to have a string of many errors, which looks daunting, caused by a single initial error.\nIs the bug reproducible - does it always happen in the same way at at the same point? It can help to restart Python and see if the bug persists - this can sometimes help in figuring out if there is a scoping issue and we are using a global variable that we did not mean to.\nIf you can’t figure out where the error occurs based on the error messages, a basic strategy is to build up code in pieces (or tear it back in pieces to a simpler version). This allows you to isolate where the error is occurring. You might use a binary search strategy. Figure out which half of the code the error occurs in. Then split the ‘bad’ half in half and figure out which half the error occurs in. Repeat until you’ve isolated the problem.\nIf you’ve written your code modularly with lots of functions, you can test individual functions. Often the error will be in what gets passed into and out of each function.\nAt the beginning of time (the 1970s?), the standard debugging strategy was to insert print statements in one’s code to see the value of a variable and thereby decipher what could be going wrong. We have better tools nowadays. But sometimes we still need to fall back to inserting print statements.\nPython is a scripting language, so you can usually run your code line by line to figure out what is happening. This can be a decent approach, particularly for simple code. However, when you are trying to find errors that occur within a series of many nested function calls or when the errors involve variable scoping (how Python looks for variables that are not local to a function), or in other complicated situations, using formal debugging tools can be much more effective. Finally, if the error occurs inside of functions provided by Python, rather than ones you write, it can be hard to run the code in those functions line by line.",

Our function is in run_with_break.py, and it contains breakpoint at the point where we want to invoke the debugger.\nNow I can call the function and will be put into debugging mode just before the next line is called:\n\nimport run_with_break as run\nrun.fit(run.data, run.n_cats)\n\nWhen I run this, I see this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; run.fit(data, n_cats)\n&gt; /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243/fall-2024/units/run_with_break.py(10)fit()\n-&gt; sub = data[data['cats'] == i]\n(Pdb) \nThis indicates I am debugging at line 10 of run_with_break.py, which is the line that creates sub, but I haven’t yet created sub.\nI can type n to run that line and go to the next one:\n(Pdb) n\n&gt; /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243/fall-2024/units/run_with_break.py(11)fit()\n-&gt; model = statsmodels.api.OLS(sub['y'], statsmodels.api.add_constant(sub['x']))\nat which point the debugger is about to execute line 11, which fits the regression.\nI can type c to continue until the next breakpoint:\n(Pdb) c\n&gt; /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243/fall-2024/units/run_with_break.py(10)fit()\n-&gt; sub = data[data['cats'] == i]\nNow if I print i, I see that it has incremented to 1.\n(Pdb) p i\n1\nWe could keep hitting n or c until hitting the stratum where an error occurs, but that would be tedious.\nLet’s hit q to quit out of the debugger.\n(Pdb) q\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\nNote that all of these commands have graphical-based equivalents in VS Code.\nNext let’s see how we can enter debugging mode only at point an error occurs.\n\n\nPost-mortem debugging\nWe’ll use a version of the module without the breakpoint() command.\n\nimport pdb\nimport run_no_break as run \n\nrun.fit(run.data, run.n_cats)\npdb.pm()\n\nThat puts us into debugging mode at the point the error occurred:\n&gt; /usr/local/linux/miniforge-3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py(86)_wrapreduction()\n-&gt; return ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n(Pdb)\nwhich turns out to be in some internal Python function that calls a reduce function, which is where the error occurs (presumably the debugger doesn’t enter this function because it calls compiled code):\n(Pdb) l\n 81                 if dtype is not None:\n 82                     return reduction(axis=axis, dtype=dtype, out=out, **passkwargs)\n 83                 else:\n 84                     return reduction(axis=axis, out=out, **passkwargs)\n 85     \n 86  -&gt;     return ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n 87     \n 88     \n 89     def _take_dispatcher(a, indices, axis=None, out=None, mode=None):\n 90         return (a, out)\n 91     \nWe can enter u multiple times (it’s only shown once below) to go up in the stack of function calls until we recognize code that we wrote:\n(Pdb) u\n&gt; /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243/fall-2024/units/run_no_break.py(10)fit()\n-&gt; model = statsmodels.api.OLS(sub['y'], statsmodels.api.add_constant(sub['x']))\nNow let’s use p to print variable values to understand the problem:\n(Pdb)  p i\n29\n(Pdb) p sub\nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: [y, x, cats]\nIndex: []\nAh, so in the 29th stratum there are no data!\n\n\npdb commands\nHere’s a list of useful pdb commands (some of which we saw above) that you can use once you’ve entered debugging mode.\n\nh or help: shows all the commands\nl or list: show the code around where the debugger is currently operating\nc or continue: continue running the code until the next breakpoint\np or print: print a variable or the result of evaluating an expression\nn or next: run the current line and go to the next line in the current function\ns or step: jump (step) into the function called in the current line (if it’s a Python function)\nr or run: exit out of the current function (e.g., if you accidentally stepped into a function) (but note this stops at breakpoints)\nunt or until: run until the next line (or unt &lt;number&gt; to run until reaching line number ); this is useful for letting a loop run until completion\nb or break: set a breakpoint\ntbreak: one-time breakpoint\nwhere: shows call stack\nu (or up) and d (or down): move up and down the call stack\nq quit out of the debugger\n&lt;return&gt;: runs the previous pdb command again\n\n\n\nInvoking pdb on a function or block of code\nWe can use pdb.run() to run a function under the debugger. We need to make sure to use s as the first pdb command in order to actually step into the function.

    "text": "Tips for avoiding bugs and catching errors\n\nPractice defensive programming\nWhen writing functions, and software more generally, you’ll want to warn the user or stop execution when there is an error and exit gracefully, giving the user some idea of what happened. Here are some things to consider:\n\ncheck function inputs and warn users if the code will do something they might not expect or makes particular choices;\ncheck inputs to if and the ranges in for loops;\nprovide reasonable default arguments;\ndocument the range of valid inputs;\ncheck that the output produced is valid; and\nstop execution based on assertions, try or raise with an informative error message.\n\nHere’s an example of building a robust square root function:\n\nimport warnings\n\ndef mysqrt(x):\n    if isinstance(x, str):\n        raise TypeError(f\"What is the square root of '{x}'?\")\n    if isinstance(x, (float, int)):\n        if x &lt; 0:\n            warnings.warn(\"Input value is negative.\", UserWarning)\n            return float('nan')   # Avoid complex number result.\n        else:\n            return x**0.5\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Cannot take the square root of {x}\")\n\n\nmysqrt(3.1)\nmysqrt(-3)\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_2537521/18181922.py:8: UserWarning:\n\nInput value is negative.\n\n\n\nnan\n\n\n\nmysqrt('hat')\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 3, in mysqrt\nTypeError: What is the square root of 'hat'?\n\n\nCatch run-time errors with try/except statements\nAlso, sometimes a function you call will fail, but you want to continue execution. For example, consider the stratified analysis show previously in which you take subsets of your data based on some categorical variable and fit a statistical model for each value of the categorical variable. If some of the subsets have no or very few observations, the statistical model fitting might fail. To do this, you might be using a for loop or apply. You want your code to continue and fit the model for the rest of the cases even if one (or more) of the cases cannot be fit. You can wrap the function call that may fail within the try statement and then your code won’t stop, even when an error occurs. Here’s a toy example.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\nimport statsmodels.api\n\nnp.random.seed(2)\nn_cats = 30\nn = 80\ny = np.random.normal(size=n)\nx = np.random.normal(size=n)\ncats = [np.random.randint(0, n_cats-1) for _ in range(n)]\ndata = pd.DataFrame({'y': y, 'x': x, 'cats': cats})\n\nparams = np.full((n_cats, 2), np.nan)\nfor i in range(n_cats):\n    sub = data[data['cats'] == i]\n    try:\n        model = statsmodels.api.OLS(sub['y'], statsmodels.api.add_constant(sub['x']))\n        fit = model.fit()\n        params[i, :] = fit.params.values\n    except Exception as error:\n        print(f\"Regression cannot be fit for stratum {i}.\")\n\nprint(params)\n\nRegression cannot be fit for stratum 7.\nRegression cannot be fit for stratum 20.\nRegression cannot be fit for stratum 24.\nRegression cannot be fit for stratum 29.\n[[ 5.52897442e-01  2.61511154e-01]\n [ 5.72564369e-01  4.37210543e-02]\n [-9.91086764e-01  2.84116572e-01]\n [-6.50606465e-01  4.26310060e-01]\n [-2.59058826e+00 -2.59058826e+00]\n [ 8.59455139e-01 -4.64514288e+00]\n [ 3.82737032e-06  3.82737032e-06]\n [            nan             nan]\n [-5.55478634e-01 -1.17864561e-01]\n [-9.11601460e-02 -5.91519525e-01]\n [-7.30270153e-01 -1.99976841e-01]\n [-1.14495705e-01 -3.06421213e-02]\n [ 4.01648095e-01  9.30890661e-01]\n [ 7.88388728e-01 -1.45835443e+00]\n [ 4.08462508e+01  6.89262864e+01]\n [ 2.95467536e-01  8.80528901e-01]\n [ 1.04592517e+00  4.55379445e+00]\n [ 6.99549010e-01 -5.17503241e-01]\n [-1.75642254e+00 -8.07798224e-01]\n [-4.49033150e-02  3.53455362e-01]\n [            nan             nan]\n [ 2.63097970e-01  2.63097970e-01]\n [ 1.13328314e+00 -1.39985074e-01]\n [ 1.17996663e+00  3.68770563e-01]\n [            nan             nan]\n [-3.85101497e-03 -3.85101497e-03]\n [-8.04536124e-01 -5.19470059e-01]\n [-5.19200779e-01 -1.39952387e-01]\n [-9.16593858e-01 -2.67613324e-01]\n [            nan             nan]]\n\n\nThe stratum with id 7 had no observations, so that call to do the regression failed, but the loop continued because we ‘caught’ the error with try. In this example, we could have checked the sample size for the subset before doing the regression, but in other contexts, we may not have an easy way to check in advance whether the function call will fail.\n\n\nMaintain dimensionality\nPython (usually helpfully) drops array dimensions that are extraneous. This can sometimes confuse later code that expects an object of a certain dimension. Here’s a work-around:\n\nimport numpy as np\nmat = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nnp.sum(mat, axis=0)         # This sums columns, as desired\n\nrow_subset = 1\nmat2 = mat[row_subset, :]\nnp.sum(mat2, axis=0)        # This sums the elements, not the columns.\n\nif len(mat2.shape) != 2:    # Fix dimensionality.\n    mat2 = mat2.reshape(1, -1)\n\n\nnp.sum(mat2, axis=0)   \n\narray([3, 4])\n\n\nIn this simple case it’s obvious that a dimension will be dropped, but in more complicated settings, this can easily occur for some inputs without the coder realizing that it may happen. Not dropping dimensions is much easier than putting checks in to see if dimensions have been dropped and having the code behave differently depending on the dimensionality.\n\n\nFind and avoid global variables\nIn general, using global variables (variables that are not created or passed into a function) results in code that is not robust. Results will change if you or a user modifies that global variable, usually without realizing/remembering that a function depends on it.\nOne ad hoc strategy is to remove objects you don’t need from Python’s global scope, to avoid accidentally using values from an old object via Python’s scoping rules. You can also run your function in a fresh session to see if it’s unable to find variables.\n\ndel x   # Mimic having a fresh sesson (knowing in this case `x` is global).\n\ndef f(z):\n    y = 3\n    print(x + y + z)\n\ntry:\n    f(2)\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\nname 'x' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous tips\n\nUse core Python functionality and algorithms already coded. Figure out if a functionality already exists in (or can be adapted from) an Python package (or potentially in a C/Fortran library/package): code that is part of standard mathematical/numerical packages will probably be more efficient and bug-free than anything you would write.\nCode in a modular fashion, making good use of functions, so that you don’t need to debug the same code multiple times. Smaller functions are easier to debug, easier to understand, and can be combined in a modular fashion (like the UNIX utilities).\nWrite code for clarity and accuracy first; then worry about efficiency. Write an initial version of the code in the simplest way, without trying to be efficient (e.g., you might use for loops even if you’re coding in Python); then make a second version that employs efficiency tricks and check that both produce the same output.\nPlan out your code in advance, including all special cases/possibilities.\nWrite tests for your code early in the process.\nBuild up code in pieces, testing along the way. Make big changes in small steps, sequentially checking to see if the code has broken on test case(s).\nBe careful that the conditions of if statements and while loops and the sequences of for loops are robust.\nDon’t hard code numbers - use variables (e.g., number of iterations, parameter values in simulations), even if you don’t expect to change the value, as this makes the code more readable and reduces bugs when you use the same number multiple times; e.g. speed_of_light = 3e8 or n_its = 1000.\n\nIn a future Lab, we’ll go over debugging in detail.\n\n\nCode review\nIt’s a good idea to have others review your code, ideally during the development process.\nThis article provides guidance on good practices for code review.",

    "text": "An editorial on ‘big data’\n‘Big data’ was trendy for a while, though I guess it’s not quite the buzzword/buzzphrase that it was a few years ago, given the AI/ML revolution, but of course that revolution is largely based on having massive datasets available (or scrapeable) online.\nPersonally, I think some of the hype around giant datasets is justified and some is hype. Large datasets allow us to address questions that we can’t with smaller datasets, and they allow us to consider more sophisticated (e.g., nonlinear) relationships than we might with a small dataset. But they do not directly help with the problem of correlation not being causation. Having medical data on every American still doesn’t tell me if higher salt intake causes hypertension. Internet transaction data does not tell me if one website feature causes increased viewership or sales. One either needs to carry out a designed experiment or think carefully about how to infer causation from observational data. Nor does big data help with the problem that an ad hoc ‘sample’ is not a statistical sample and does not provide the ability to directly infer properties of a population. Consider the immense difficulties we’ve seen in answering questions about Covid despite large amounts of data, because it is incomplete/non-representative. A well-chosen smaller dataset may be much more informative than a much larger, more ad hoc dataset. However, having big datasets might allow you to select from the dataset in a way that helps get at causation or in a way that allows you to construct a population-representative sample. Finally, having a big dataset also allows you to do a large number of statistical analyses and tests, so multiple testing is a big issue. With enough analyses, something will look interesting just by chance in the noise of the data, even if there is no underlying reality to it.\nDifferent people define the ‘big’ in big data differently. One definition involves the actual size of the data, and in some cases the speed with which it is collected. Our efforts here will focus on dataset sizes that are large for traditional statistical work but would probably not be thought of as large in some contexts such as Google or the US National Security Agency (NSA). Another definition of ‘big data’ has more to do with how pervasive data and empirical analyses backed by data are in society and not necessarily how large the actual dataset size is.",

If you have 10s of gigabytes of data, you’ll be better off if your machine has 10s of GBs of memory, as discussed in this Unit.\nIf you’re scaling to 100s of GBs, terabytes or petabytes, tools such as carefully-administered databases, cloud-based tools such as provided by AWS and Google Cloud Platform, and Spark or other such tools are probably your best bet.\nNote: in handling big data files, it’s best to have the data on the local disk of the machine you are using to reduce traffic and delays from moving data over the network.",

We’ve already seen UNIX commands for extracting columns. And various commands such as grep, head, tail, etc. allow you to pick out rows based on certain criteria. As some of you have done in problem sets, one can use awk to extract rows. So basic shell scripting may allow you to reduce your data to a more manageable size.\nThe tool GNU parallel allows you to parallelize operations from the command line and is commonly used in working on Linux clusters.\nAnd don’t forget simple things. If you have a dataset with 30 columns that takes up 10 Gb but you only need 5 of the columns, get rid of the rest and work with the smaller dataset. Or you might be able to get the same information from a random sample of your large dataset as you would from doing the analysis on the full dataset. Strategies like this will often allow you to stick with the tools you already know.\nAlso, remember that we can often store data more compactly in binary formats than in flat text (e.g., csv) files.\nFinally, for many applications, storing large datasets in a standard database will work well.",

    "text": "Overview\nA basic paradigm for working with big datasets is the MapReduce paradigm. The basic idea is to store the data in a distributed fashion across multiple nodes and try to do the computation in pieces on the data on each node. Results can also be stored in a distributed fashion.\nA key benefit of this is that if you can’t fit your dataset on disk on one machine you can on a cluster of machines. And your processing of the dataset can happen in parallel. This is the basic idea of MapReduce.\nThe basic steps of MapReduce are as follows:\n\nread individual data objects (e.g., records/lines from CSVs or individual data files)\nmap: create key-value pairs using the inputs (more formally, the map step takes a key-value pair and returns a new key-value pair)\nreduce: for each key, do an operation on the associated values and create a result - i.e., aggregate within the values assigned to each key\nwrite out the {key,result} pair\n\nA similar paradigm that is implemented in pandas and dplyr is the split-apply-combine strategy.\nA few additional comments. In our map function, we could exclude values or transform them in some way, including producing multiple records from a single record. And in our reduce function, we can do more complicated analysis. So one can actually do fairly sophisticated things within what may seem like a restrictive paradigm. But we are constrained such that in the map step, each record needs to be treated independently and in the reduce step each key needs to be treated independently. This allows for the parallelization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Shuffling’ data\n\n\n\nOne important note is that any operations that require moving a lot of data between the workers can take a long time. (This is sometimes called a shuffle.) This could happen if, for example, you computed the median value within each of many groups if the data for each group are spread across the workers. In contrast, if we compute the mean or sum, one can compute the partial sums on each worker and then just add up the partial sums.\n\n\nNote that as discussed in Unit 5 the concepts of map and reduce are core concepts in functional programming, and of course Python provides the map function.\nHadoop is an infrastructure for enabling MapReduce across a network of machines. The basic idea is to hide the complexity of distributing the calculations and collecting results. Hadoop includes a file system for distributed storage (HDFS), where each piece of information is stored redundantly (on multiple machines). Calculations can then be done in a parallel fashion, often on data in place on each machine thereby limiting the amount of communication that has to be done over the network. Hadoop also monitors completion of tasks and if a node fails, it will redo the relevant tasks on another node. Hadoop is based on Java. Given the popularity of Spark, I’m not sure how much usage these approaches currently see. Setting up a Hadoop cluster can be tricky. Hopefully if you’re in a position to need to use Hadoop, it will be set up for you and you will be interacting with it as a user/data analyst.\nOk, so what is Spark? You can think of Spark as in-memory Hadoop. Spark allows one to treat the memory across multiple nodes as a big pool of memory. Therefore, Spark should be faster than Hadoop when the data will fit in the collective memory of multiple nodes. In cases where it does not, Spark will make use of the HDFS (and generally, Spark will be reading the data initially from HDFS.) While Spark is more user-friendly than Hadoop, there are also some things that can make it hard to use. Setting up a Spark cluster also involves a bit of work, Spark can be hard to configure for optimal performance, and Spark calculations have a tendency to fail (often involving memory issues) in ways that are hard for users to debug.",

    "section": "Using Dask for big data processing",
    "text": "Using Dask for big data processing\nUnit 6 on parallelization gives an overview of using Dask for flexible parallelization on different kinds of computational resources (in particular, parallelizing across multiple cores on one machine versus parallelizing across multiple cores across multiple machines/nodes).\nHere we’ll see the use of Dask to work with distributed datasets. Dask can process datasets (potentially very large ones) by parallelizing operations across subsets of the data using multiple cores on one or more machines.\nLike Spark, Dask automatically reads data from files in parallel and operates on chunks (also called partitions or shards) of the full dataset in parallel. There are two big advantages of this:\n\nYou can do calculations (including reading from disk) in parallel because each worker will work on a piece of the data.\nWhen the data is split across machines, you can use the memory of multiple machines to handle much larger datasets than would be possible in memory on one machine. That said, Dask processes the data in chunks, so one often doesn’t need a lot of memory, even just on one machine.\n\nWhile reading from disk in parallel is a good goal, if all the data are on one hard drive, there are limitations on the speed of reading the data from disk because of having multiple processes all trying to access the disk at once. Supercomputing systems will generally have parallel file systems that support truly parallel reading (and writing, i.e., parallel I/O). Hadoop/Spark deal with this by distributing across multiple disks, generally one disk per machine/node.\nBecause computations are done in external compiled code (e.g., via numpy) it’s effective to use the threads scheduler when operating on one node to avoid having to copy and move the data.\n\nDask dataframes (pandas)\nDask dataframes are Pandas-like dataframes where each dataframe is split into groups of rows, stored as smaller Pandas dataframes.\nOne can do a lot of the kinds of computations that you would do on a Pandas dataframe on a Dask dataframe, but many operations are not possible. See here.\nBy default dataframes are handled by the threads scheduler. (Recall we discussed Dask’s various schedulers in Unit 6.)\nHere’s an example of reading from a dataset of flight delays (about 11 GB data). You can get the data here.\nWe’ll specify some dtypes as otherwise Pandas complains about the fact that some columns mix what appear to be ints and floats.\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler='threads', num_workers = 4)  \nimport dask.dataframe as ddf\npath = '/scratch/users/paciorek/243/AirlineData/csvs/'\nair = ddf.read_csv(path + '*.csv.bz2',\n      compression = 'bz2',\n      encoding = 'latin1', # (unexpected) latin1 value(s) in TailNum field in 2001\n      dtype = {'Distance': 'float64', 'CRSElapsedTime': 'float64',\n      'TailNum': 'object', 'CancellationCode': 'object', 'DepDelay': 'float64',\n      'ActualElapsedTime': 'float64', 'ArrDelay': 'float64', 'ArrTime': 'float64',\n       'DepTime': 'float64'})\nair\nair.npartitions\n\nDask will reads the data in parallel from the various .csv.bz2 files (unzipping on the fly), but note the caveat in the previous section about the possibilities for truly parallel I/O.\nHowever, recall that Dask uses delayed (lazy) evaluation. In this case, the reading is delayed until compute() is called. For that matter, the various other calculations (max, groupby, mean) shown below are only done after compute() is called.\n\nimport time\n\nt0 = time.time()\nair.DepDelay.max().compute()   # This takes a while.\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\nt0 = time.time()\nair.DepDelay.mean().compute()   # This takes a while.\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\nair.DepDelay.median().compute() \n\nWe’ll discuss in class why Dask won’t do the median. Consider the discussion about moving data in the earlier section on MapReduce.\nNext let’s see a full split-apply-combine (aka MapReduce) type of analysis.\n\nsub = air[(air.UniqueCarrier == 'UA') & (air.Origin == 'SFO')]\nbyDest = sub.groupby('Dest').DepDelay.mean()\nresults = byDest.compute()            # This takes a while too.\nresults\n\nYou should see this:\n    Dest \n    ACV 26.200000 \n    BFL 1.000000 \n    BOI 12.855069 \n    BOS 9.316795 \n    CLE 4.000000\n    ...\nNote: calling compute twice is a bad idea as Dask will read in the data twice - more on this in a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory use for results objects\n\n\n\nThink carefully about the size of the result from calling compute. The result will be returned as a standard Python object, not distributed across multiple workers (and possibly machines), and with the object entirely in memory. It’s easy to accidentally return an entire giant dataset.\n\n\n\n\nDask bags\nBags are like lists but there is no particular ordering, so it doesn’t make sense to ask for the i’th element.\nYou can think of operations on Dask bags as being like parallel map operations on lists in Python or R.\nBy default bags are handled via the processes scheduler.\nLet’s see some basic operations on a large dataset of Wikipedia log files. You can get a subset of the Wikipedia data here.\nHere we again read the data in (which Dask will do in parallel):\n\nimport dask.multiprocessing\ndask.config.set(scheduler='processes', num_workers = 4)  \nimport dask.bag as db\n## This is the full data\n## path = '/scratch/users/paciorek/wikistats/dated_2017/'\n## For demo we'll just use a small subset.\npath = '/scratch/users/paciorek/wikistats/dated_2017_small/dated/'\nwiki = db.read_text(path + 'part-0*gz')\n\nHere we’ll just count the number of records.\n\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nwiki.count().compute()\ntime.time() - t0   # 136 sec. for full data\n\nAnd here is a more realistic example of filtering (subsetting).\n\nimport re\n\ndef find(line, regex = 'Armenia'):\n    vals = line.split(' ')\n    if len(vals) &lt; 6:\n        return(False)\n    tmp = re.search(regex, vals[3])\n    if tmp is None:\n        return(False)\n    else:\n        return(True)\n    \n\nwiki.filter(find).count().compute()\n\narmenia = wiki.filter(find)\nsmp = armenia.take(100)   # Grab a handful as proof of concept.\nsmp[0:5]\n\nNote that it is quite inefficient to do the find() (and implicitly read the data in) and then compute on top of that intermediate result in two separate calls to compute(). Rather, we should set up the code so that all the operations are set up before a single call to compute(). This is discussed in detail in the Dask/future tutorial.\nSince the data are just treated as raw strings, we might want to introduce structure by converting each line to a tuple and then converting to a data frame.\n\ndef make_tuple(line):\n    return(tuple(line.split(' ')))\n\ndtypes = {'date': 'object', 'time': 'object', 'language': 'object',\n'webpage': 'object', 'hits': 'float64', 'size': 'float64'}\n\n## Let's create a Dask dataframe. \n## This will take a while if done on full data.\ndf = armenia.map(make_tuple).to_dataframe(dtypes)\ntype(df)\n\n## Now let's actually do the computation,\n## returning a **Pandas** (not Dask) df to the main process.\nresult = df.compute()  \ntype(result)\nresult[0:5]\n\n\n\nDask arrays (numpy)\nDask arrays are numpy-like arrays where each array is split up by both rows and columns into smaller numpy arrays.\nOne can do a lot of the kinds of computations that you would do on a numpy array on a Dask array, but many operations are not possible. See here.\nBy default arrays are handled via the threads scheduler.\n\nNon-distributed arrays\nLet’s first see operations on a single node, using a single 13 GB two-dimensional array. Again, Dask uses lazy evaluation, so creation of the array doesn’t happen until an operation requiring output is done.\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler = 'threads', num_workers = 4) \nimport dask.array as da\nx = da.random.normal(0, 1, size=(40000,40000), chunks=(10000, 10000))\n# square 10k x 10k chunks\nmycalc = da.mean(x, axis = 1)  # by row\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nrs = mycalc.compute()\ntime.time() - t0  # 41 sec.\n\nFor a row-based operation, we would presumably only want to chunk things up by row, but this doesn’t seem to actually make a difference, presumably because the mean calculation can be done in pieces and only a small number of summary statistics moved between workers.\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler='threads', num_workers = 4)  \nimport dask.array as da\n# x = da.from_array(x, chunks=(2500, 40000))  # How to adjust chunk size of existing array.\nx = da.random.normal(0, 1, size=(40000,40000), chunks=(2500, 40000))\nmycalc = da.mean(x, axis = 1)  # row means\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nrs = mycalc.compute()\ntime.time() - t0   # 42 sec.\n\nOf course, given the lazy evaluation, this timing comparison is not just timing the actual row mean calculations.\nBut this doesn’t really clarify the story…\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler='threads', num_workers = 4)  \nimport dask.array as da\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nx = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(40000,40000))\ntime.time() - t0   # 110 sec.\n# For some reason the `from_array` and `da.mean` calculations are not done lazily here.\nt0 = time.time()\ndx = da.from_array(x, chunks=(2500, 40000))\ntime.time() - t0   # 27 sec.\nt0 = time.time()\nmycalc = da.mean(x, axis = 1)  # What is this doing given .compute() also takes time?\ntime.time() - t0   # 28 sec.\nt0 = time.time()\nrs = mycalc.compute()\ntime.time() - t0   # 21 sec.\n\nDask will avoid storing all the chunks in memory. (It appears to just generate them on the fly.) Here we have an 80 GB array, but we never use more than a few GB of memory (based on top or free -h).\n\nimport dask\ndask.config.set(scheduler='threads', num_workers = 4)  \nimport dask.array as da\nx = da.random.normal(0, 1, size=(100000,100000), chunks=(10000, 10000))\nmycalc = da.mean(x, axis = 1)  # row means\nimport time\nt0 = time.time()\nrs = mycalc.compute()\ntime.time() - t0   # 205 sec.\nrs[0:5]\n\n\n\nDistributed arrays\nUsing arrays distributed across multiple machines should be straightforward based on using Dask distributed. However, one would want to be careful about creating arrays by distributing the data from a single Python process as that would involve copying between machines.",

Some of the tables in a given database will generally have fields in common so it makes sense to merge (i.e., join) information from multiple tables. E.g., you might have a database with a table of student information, a table of teacher information and a table of school information, and you might join student information with information about the teacher(s) who taught the students. Databases are set up to allow for fast querying and merging (called joins in database terminology).\n\nMemory and disk use\nFormally, databases are stored on disk, while Python and R store datasets in memory. This would suggest that databases will be slow to access their data but will be able to store more data than can be loaded into an Python or R session. However, databases can be quite fast due in part to disk caching by the operating system as well as careful implementation of good algorithms for database operations.",

    "text": "Interacting with a database\nYou can interact with databases in a variety of database systems (DBMS=database management system). Some popular systems are SQLite, DuckDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft Access. We’ll concentrate on accessing data in a database rather than management of databases. SQL is the Structured Query Language and is a special-purpose high-level language for managing databases and making queries. Variations on SQL are used in many different DBMS.\nQueries are the way that the user gets information (often simply subsets of tables or information merged across tables). The result of an SQL query is in general another table, though in some cases it might have only one row and/or one column.\nMany DBMS have a client-server model. Clients connect to the server, with some authentication, and make requests (i.e., queries).\nThere are often multiple ways to interact with a DBMS, including directly using command line tools provided by the DBMS or via Python or R, among others.\nWe’ll concentrate on SQLite (because it is simple to use on a single machine). SQLite is quite nice in terms of being self-contained - there is no server-client model, just a single file on your hard drive that stores the database and to which you can connect to using the SQLite shell, R, Python, etc. However, it does not have some useful functionality that other DBMS have. For example, you can’t use ALTER TABLE to modify column types or drop columns.\nA good alternative to SQLite that I encourage you to consider is DuckDB. DuckDB stores data column-wise, which can lead to big speedups when doing queries operating on large portions of tables (so-called “online analytical processing” (OLAP)). Another nice feature of DuckDB is that it can interact with data on disk without always having to read all the data into memory.\nIn the demo code, we’ll have the option to use either SQLite or DuckDB.",

    "section": "Database schema and normalization",
    "text": "Database schema and normalization\nTo truly leverage the conceptual and computational power of a database you’ll want to have your data in a normalized form, which means spreading your data across multiple tables in such a way that you don’t repeat information unnecessarily.\nThe schema is the metadata about the tables in the database and the fields (and their types) in those tables.\nLet’s consider this using an educational example. Suppose we have a school with multiple teachers teaching multiple classes and multiple students taking multiple classes. If we put this all in one table organized per student, the data might have the following fields:\n\nstudent ID\nstudent grade level\nstudent name\nclass 1\nclass 2\n…\nclass n\ngrade in class 1\ngrade in class 2\n…\ngrade in class n\nteacher ID 1\nteacher ID 2\n…\nteacher ID n\nteacher name 1\nteacher name 2\n…\nteacher name n\nteacher department 1\nteacher department 2\n…\nteacher department n\nteacher age 1\nteacher age 2\n…\nteacher age n\n\nThere are a lot of problems with this:\n\nA lot of information is repeated across rows (e.g., teacher age for students who have the same teacher) - this is a waste of space - it is hard/error-prone to update values in the database (e.g., after a teacher’s birthday), because a given value needs to be updated in multiple places\nThere are potentially a lot of empty cells (e.g., for a student who takes fewer than ‘n’ classes). This will generally result in a waste of space.\nIt’s hard to see the information that is not organized uniquely by row – i.e., it’s much easier to understand the information at the student level than the teacher level\nWe have to know in advance how big ‘n’ is. Then if a single student takes more than ‘n’ classes, the whole database needs to be restructured.\n\nIt would get even worse if there was a field related to teachers for which a given teacher could have multiple values (e.g., teachers could be in multiple departments). This would lead to even more redundancy - each student-class-teacher combination would be crossed with all of the departments for the teacher (so-called multivalued dependency in database theory).\nAn alternative organization of the data would be to have each row represent the enrollment of a student in a class.\n\nstudent ID\nstudent name\nclass\ngrade in class\nstudent grade level\nteacher ID\nteacher department\nteacher age\n\nThis has some advantages relative to our original organization in terms of not having empty cells, but it doesn’t solve the other three issues above.\nInstead, a natural way to order this database is with the following four tables.\n\nStudent\n\nID\nname\ngrade_level\n\nTeacher\n\nID\nname\ndepartment\nage\n\nClass\n\nID\ntopic\nclass_size\nteacher_ID\n\nEnrollment\n\nstudent_ID\nclass_ID\ngrade\n\n\nThe Enrollment table has one row per student-class pair. Having a table like this handles “ragged” data where the number of observations per unit (in this case classes per student) varies. Using such tables is a common pattern when considering how to normalize a database. It’s also a core part of the idea of “tidy data” and data in long format, seen in the tidyr package.\nThen we do queries to pull information from multiple tables. We do the joins based on keys, which are the fields in each table that allow us to match rows from different tables.\n(That said, if all anticipated uses of a database will end up recombining the same set of tables, we may want to have a denormalized schema in which those tables are actually combined in the database. It is possible to be too pure about normalization! We can also create a virtual table, called a view, as discussed later.)\n\nKeys\nA key is a field or collection of fields that give(s) a unique value for every row/observation. A table in a database should then have a primary key that is the main unique identifier used by the DBMS. Foreign keys are columns in one table that give the value of the primary key in another table. When information from multiple tables is joined together, the matching of a row from one table to a row in another table is generally done by equating the primary key in one table with a foreign key in a different table.\nIn our educational example, the primary keys would presumably be: Student.ID, Teacher.ID, Class.ID, and for Enrollment a primary key made of two fields: {Enrollment.studentID, Enrollment.class_ID}.\nSome examples of foreign keys would be:\n\nstudent_ID as the foreign key in Enrollment for joining with Student on Student.ID\nteacher_ID as the foreign key in Class for joining with Teacher based on Teacher.ID\nclass_ID as the foreign key in Enrollment for joining with Class based on Class.ID\n\n\n\nQueries that join data across multiple tables\nSuppose we want a result that has the grades of all students in 9th grade. For this we need information from the Student table (to determine grade level) and information from the Enrollment table (to determine the class grade). More specifically we need a query that:\n\njoins Student with Enrollment based on matching rows in Student with rows in Enrollment where Student.ID is the same as Enrollment.student_ID and\nfilters the rows based on Student.grade_level:\n\n#| eval: false\nSELECT Student.ID, grade FROM Student, Enrollment WHERE \n  Student.ID = Enrollment.student_ID and Student.grade_level = 9;\nNote that the query is a join (specifically an inner join), which is like merge() (or dplyr::join) in R. We don’t specifically use the JOIN keyword, but one could do these queries explicitly using JOIN, as we’ll see later.",

    "text": "Accessing databases in Python\nPython provides a variety of front-end packages for manipulating databases from a variety of DBMS (SQLite, DuckDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, among others). Basically, you start with a bit of code that links to the actual database, and then you can easily query the database using SQL syntax regardless of the back-end. The Python function calls that wrap around the SQL syntax will also look the same regardless of the back-end (basically execute(\"SOME SQL STATEMENT\")).\nWith SQLite, Python processes make calls against the stand-alone SQLite database (.db) file, so there are no SQLite-specific processes. With a client-server DBMS like PostgreSQL, Python processes call out to separate Postgres processes; these are started from the overall Postgres background process\nYou can access and navigate an SQLite database from Python as follows.\n\nimport sqlite3 as sq\ndir_path = '../data'  # Replace with the actual path\ndb_filename = 'stackoverflow-2021.db'\n## Download from http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/share/paciorek/stackoverflow-2021.db.\n\ncon = sq.connect(os.path.join(dir_path, db_filename))\ndb = con.cursor()\ndb.execute(\"select * from questions limit 3\")  # simple query \ndb.fetchall() # retrieve results\n\n&lt;sqlite3.Cursor at 0x7f9e0fbcbf40&gt;\n\n\n[(65534165.0,\n  '2021-01-01 22:15:54',\n  0.0,\n  112.0,\n  2.0,\n  0.0,\n  None,\n  \"Can't update a value in sqlite3\",\n  13189393.0),\n (65535296.0,\n  '2021-01-02 01:33:13',\n  2.0,\n  1109.0,\n  0.0,\n  0.0,\n  None,\n  'Install and run ROS on Google Colab',\n  14924336.0),\n (65535910.0,\n  '2021-01-02 04:01:34',\n  -1.0,\n  110.0,\n  1.0,\n  8.0,\n  0.0,\n  'Operators on date/time fields',\n  651174.0)]\n\n\nAlternatively, we could use DuckDB, but I haven’t run this code while rendering this document.\n\nimport duckdb as dd\ndir_path = '../data'  # Replace with the actual path\ndb_filename = 'stackoverflow-2021.duckdb' \n## Download from http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/share/paciorek/stackoverflow-2021.duckdb.\n\ncon = dd.connect(os.path.join(dir_path, db_filename))\ndb = con.cursor()\ndb.execute(\"select * from questions limit 5\")  # simple query \ndb.fetchall() # retrieve results\n\nWe can (fairly) easily see the tables in SQLite (this is easier from R):\n\ndef db_list_tables(db):\n    db.execute(\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';\")\n    tables = db.fetchall()\n    return [table[0] for table in tables]\n\ndb_list_tables(db)\n\n['questions', 'answers', 'questions_tags', 'users']\n\n\nOr it’s easy in DuckDB (code not executed while rendering).\n\ncon.execute(\"show tables\").fetchall()\n\nTo see the fields in the table, if you’ve just queried the table, you can look at description:\n\ndb.execute(\"select * from questions\")\n\n[item[0] for item in db.description]\n\ndef get_fields():\n    return [item[0] for item in db.description]\n\n&lt;sqlite3.Cursor at 0x7f9e0fbcbf40&gt;\n\n\n['questionid',\n 'creationdate',\n 'score',\n 'viewcount',\n 'answercount',\n 'commentcount',\n 'favoritecount',\n 'title',\n 'ownerid']\n\n\nHere’s how to make a basic SQL query. One can either make the query and get the results in one go or make the query and separately fetch the results. Here we’ve selected the first five rows (and all columns, based on the * wildcard) and brought them into Python as list of tuples.\n\nresults = db.execute(\"select * from questions limit 5\").fetchall()  # simple query \ntype(results)\ntype(results[0])\n\nquery = db.execute(\"select * from questions\")  # simple query \nresults2 = query.fetchmany(5)\nresults == results2\n\nlist\n\n\ntuple\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nTo disconnect from the database:\n\ndb.close()\n\nIt’s convenient to get a Pandas dataframe back as the result. To do that we can execute queries like this:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nresults = pd.read_sql(\"select * from questions limit 5\", con)\n\nIf I do that with DuckDB rather than SQLite, I get a warning, but it seems to work.",

    "section": "More on joins",
    "text": "More on joins\nWe’ve seen a bunch of joins but haven’t discussed the full taxonomy of types of joins. There are various possibilities for how to do a join depending on whether there are rows in one table that do not match any rows in the other table.\nInner joins: In database terminology an inner join is when the result has a row for each match of a row in one table with the rows in the second table, where the matching is done on the columns you indicate. If a row in one table corresponds to more than one row in another table, you get all of the matching rows in the second table, with the information from the first table duplicated for each of the resulting rows. For example in the Stack Overflow data, an inner join of questions and answers would pair each question with each of the answers to that question. However, questions without any answers or (if this were possible) answers without a corresponding question would not be part of the result.\nOuter joins: Outer joins add additional rows from one table that do not match any rows from the other table as follows. A left outer join gives all the rows from the first table but only those from the second table that match a row in the first table. A right outer join is the converse, while a full outer join includes at least one copy of all rows from both tables. So a left outer join of the Stack Overflow questions and answers tables would, in addition to the matched questions and their answers, include a row for each question without any answers, as would a full outer join. In this case there should be no answers that do not correspond to question, so a right outer join should be the same as an inner join.\nCross joins: A cross join gives the Cartesian product of the two tables, namely the pairwise combination of every row from each table. I.e., take a row from the first table and pair it with each row from the second table, then repeat that for all rows from the first table. Since cross joins pair each row in one table with all the rows in another table, the resulting table can be quite large (the product of the number of rows in the two tables). In the Stack Overflow database, a cross join would pair each question with every answer in the database, regardless of whether the answer is an answer to that question.\nSimply listing two or more tables separated by commas as we saw earlier is the same as a cross join. Alternatively, listing two or more tables separated by commas, followed by conditions that equate rows in one table to rows in another is equivalent to an inner join.\nIn general, inner joins can be seen as a form of cross join followed by a condition that enforces matching between the rows of the table. More broadly, here are four equivalent joins that all perform the equivalent of an inner join:\n#| eval: false\n## explicit inner join:\nselect * from table1 join table2 on table1.id = table2.id \n## non-explicit join without JOIN\nselect * from table1, table2 where table1.id = table2.id \n## cross-join followed by matching\nselect * from table1 cross join table2 where table1.id = table2.id \n## explicit inner join with 'using'\nselect * from table1 join table2 using(id)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nCreate a view with one row for every question-tag pair, including questions without any tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nWrite a query that would return the displaynames of all of the users who have never posted a question. The NULL keyword will come in handy it’s like ‘NA’ in R. Hint: NULLs should be produced if you do an outer join.",

    "text": "Indexes\nAn index is an ordering of rows based on one or more fields. DBMS use indexes to look up values quickly, either when filtering (if the index is involved in the WHERE condition) or when doing joins (if the index is involved in the JOIN condition). So in general you want your tables to have indexes.\nDBMS use indexing to provide sub-linear time lookup. Without indexes, a database needs to scan through every row sequentially, which is called linear time lookup. If there are ‘n’ rows, the lookup is \\(O(n)\\) in computational cost. With indexes, lookup may be logarithmic \\(O(log(n))\\) (if using tree-based indexes) or constant time \\(O(1)\\) (if using hash-based indexes). A binary tree-based search is logarithmic; at each step through the tree you can eliminate half of the possibilities.\nWhile that seems to suggest hash-based indexes are better, that is only the case when looking for exact matches (such as particular specific tags), as the hash index would be based on hashing the value of the field or fields used for the index. If one wanted to look for a range of values (such as a range of viewcount values), then a tree-based index would be more natural.\nHere’s how we create an index, with some time comparison for a simple query.\n\nt0 = time.time()\nresults = db.execute(\n  \"select * from questions where viewcount &gt; 10000\").fetchall()\nprint(time.time() - t0)  # 10 seconds\nt0 = time.time()\ndb.execute(\n  \"create index count_index on questions (viewcount)\")\nprint(time.time() - t0)  # 19 seconds\nt0 = time.time()\ndb.execute(\n  \"select * from questions where viewcount &gt; 10000\").fetchall()  \nprint(time.time() - t0)  # 3 seconds\n\nIn other contexts, an index can save huge amounts of time. So if you’re working with a database and speed is important, check to see if there are indexes. That said, as seen above it takes time to create the index, so you’d only want to create it if you were doing multiple queries that could take advantage of the index. See the databases tutorial for more discussion of how using indexes in a lookup is not always advantageous.",

In the example below one could do it with a join, but the syntax is often more complicated.\nConsider the following example of using INTERSECT. What does it return?\n\nresult1 = db.execute(\"select displayname, userid from \\\n                     questions Q join users U on U.userid = Q.ownerid \\\n                     intersect \\\n                     select displayname, userid from \\\n                     answers A join users U on U.userid = A.ownerid\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nWhat if you wanted to find users who had neither asked nor answered a question?",

    "text": "Subqueries\nA subquery is a full query that is embedded in a larger query. These can be quite handy in building up complicated queries. One could instead use temporary tables (views), but it often is easier to write all in one query (and that lets the database’s query optimizer operate on the entire query).\n\nSubqueries in the FROM statement\nWe can use subqueries in the FROM statement to create a temporary table to use in a query. Here we’ll do it in the context of a join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nWhat does the following do?\n\n\n\ndb.execute(\"select * from questions join answers A \\\n           on questions.questionid = A.questionid \\\n           join \\\n           (select ownerid, count(*) as n_answered from answers \\\n           group by ownerid order by n_answered desc limit 1000) most_responsive \\\n           on A.ownerid = most_responsive.ownerid\")\n\nIt might be hard to just come up with that full query all at once. A good strategy is probably to think about creating a view that is the result of the inner query and then have the outer query use that. You can then piece together the complicated query in a modular way. For big databases, you are likely to want to submit this as a single query and not two queries so that the SQL optimizer can determine the best way to do the operations. But you want to start with code that you’re confident will give you the right answer!\nNote we could also have done that query using a subquery in the WHERE statement, as discussed in the next section.\n\n\nSubqueries in the WHERE statement\nInstead of a join, we can use subqueries as a way to combine information across tables, with the subquery involved in a WHERE statement. The subquery creates a set and we then can check for inclusion in (or exclusion from with not in) that set.\nFor example, suppose we want to know the average number of UpVotes for users who have posted a question with the tag “python”.\n\ndb.execute(\"select avg(upvotes) from users where userid in \\\n           (select distinct ownerid from \\\n           questions join questions_tags \\\n           on questions.questionid = questions_tags.questionid \\\n           where tag = 'python')\").fetchall()\n\n[(62.72529394895326,)]",

Running your code manually and seeing if it works is a workable strategy for simple one-time scripts that do simple tasks, but there are situations (like writing a function that others will repeatedly use, or like running the same piece of code on hundreds of files or URLs) where it is prudent to test your code ahead of its actual use or deployment.

Refer to Using regex in Python for a quick overview of Python’s re package.\n2- Write an interface for that function (a function name and arguments), but do not implement the function yet (you can have it return an None, or an empty string for now). We will do this in a good old fashioned .py file (not a notebook or a quarto file).\n3- Build a test suite using the pytest package to test that your function works as intended. Add at least 8 test cases with justification for each. Try to cover the main use cases, and as many potential corner cases or boundary conditions as possible.\n4- Now run the test suite. It should fail for all your tests (unless one of them was passing an empty string).\n5- Implement the function. You can do this at one go, or case by case. As you implement a case, you can rerun the test suite and see some of the tests relevant to that cases stopping to fail. When all the tests pass, you are done. This is called test-driven development.\n6- If some cases are still failing, that’s alright, we can use that failing code next week for demonstrating debugging functionality.\n7- Make sure you raise an exception to trap invalid input types.\n8- Add a test to check that an exception is properly raised when the function is given invalid input types.",

But there are several caveats here. Try installing those packages and document your experience. Creating a conda environment using the provided requirements.txt file may be a reasonable attempt: conda create --name lab4 python=3.11 --file requirements.txt. If it fails on your system, try to identify why.\nAs an alternative, you may try the following command to generate an adjusted requirements file to be then to install packages:\n\ngrep -rh import . |\n    sed -e 's/\"//g; s/,//g; s/\\\\n//g; s/^ *//g; s/ *$//g; /^\\(import \\|from \\)/!d' |\n    cut -d ' ' -f 2 |\n    cut -d '.' -f 1 |\n    sort |\n    uniq |\n    grep -f - requirements.txt |\n    grep -v '^#' |\n    cut -d '=' -f 1,2 |\n    sed 's/=/==/g' |\n    grep -v '_' |\n    grep -v '\\-base' &gt;\n    requirements_adjusted.txt\n\nRunning the command above incrementally might be useful to better understand what each step does if it is not immediately clear. Installing the packages should then be less prone to error by using this requirements_adjusted.txt file. You will also need nbformat==5.9.2 and jinja2==3.1.2 to be installed.

The latter is a good place for large datasets, but note that /scratch is not backed up, unlike your home directory. See the previous link for more info.

Briefly (a few sentences) describe the difference between disk and memory based on that reference and/or other resources you find.\nThis problem uses the ideas and tools in Unit 2, Sections 1-3 to explore approaches to reading and writing data from files and to consider file sizes in ASCII plain text vs. binary formats in light of the fact that numbers are (generally) stored as 8 bytes per number in binary formats.\n\nGenerate a numpy array (named x) of random numbers from a standard normal distribution with 20 columns and as many rows as needed so that the data take up about 16 MB (megabytes) in size. As part of your answer, show the arithmetic (formatted using LaTeX math syntax) you did to determine the number of rows.\nExplain the sizes of the two files created below. In discussing the CSV text file, how many characters do you expect to be in the file (i.e., you should be able to estimate this reasonably accurately from first principles without using wc or any explicit program that counts characters). Hint: what do we know about numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution?\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nx = x.round(decimals = 12)\n\npd.DataFrame(x).to_csv('x.csv', header = False, index = False)\nprint(f\"{str(os.path.getsize('x.csv')/1e6)} MB\")\n\npd.DataFrame(x).to_pickle('x.pkl', compression = None) \nprint(f\"{str(os.path.getsize('x.pkl')/1e6)} MB\")\n\n30.777135 MB\n16.000572 MB\n\n\nSuppose we had rounded each number to four decimal places. Would using CSV have saved disk space relative to the pickle file?\nNow consider saving out the numbers one number per row in a CSV file. Given we no longer have to save all the commas, why is the file size unchanged?\nRead the CSV file into Python using pandas.read_csv. Compare the speed of reading the CSV to reading the pickle file with pandas.read_pickle. Note that in some cases you might find that the first time you read a file is slower; if so this has to do with the operating system caching the file in memory (we’ll discuss this further in Unit 7 when we talk about databases).\nFinally, in the next parts of the question, we’ll consider reading the CSV file in chunks as discussed in Unit 2. First, time how long it takes to read the first 10,000 rows in a single chunk using nrows.\nNow experiment with the skiprows to see if you can read in a large chunk of data from the middle of the file as quickly as the same size chunk from the start of the file. What does this indicate regarding whether Pandas/Python has to read in all the data up to the point where the chunk in the middle starts or can skip over it in some fashion? Is there any savings relative to reading all the initial rows and the chunk in the middle all at once?\n\nPlease read the Code syntax and style section of Unit 4 on good programming/project practices and incorporate what you’ve learned from that reading into your solution for Problem 4. (You can skip the section on Assertions and Testing, as we’ll cover that in Lab.) In particular, lint your code (e.g., using ruff or another tool of your choice as discussed in the Unit 4. (This is most straightforward for code in a .py file. If your code is directly in the qmd file, you probably need to copy-paste it into another file to lint it, unfortunately. If anyone figures out a good way to directly lint the code chunks, please post on Ed!)\nAs your response to this question, very briefly (a few sentences) note what you did in your code for Problem 4 that reflects what you read. Please also note anything in what you read in Unit 4 that you disagree with, if you have a different stylistic perspective.\nWe’ll experiment with webscraping and manipulating HTML by getting publication information off of Google Scholar. Note that Google Scholar does not have an API, so we are forced to deconstruct the queries that are produced when we point and click on the website.\nYour functions may be short enough that it’s ok to put a function directly within a code chunk in your qmd file. Or you might choose to put one or more functions into a .py file and use inspect.getsource() to show us the code. For this problem in which the focus of the work is the function and how it works, it will generally be best to show the function code as part of the problem solution rather than in an appendix.\n\nGo to Google Scholar and enter the name (including first name to help with disambiguation) for a researcher whose work interests you. (If you want to do the one that will match the problem set solutions, you can use “Michael Jordan”, who is a well-known statistician and machine learning researcher here at Berkeley.) If you’ve entered the name of a researcher that Google Scholar recognizes as having a Google Scholar profile, you should see that the first item shown in the results page is a “User profile”. Now, based on the information returned, show the HTML element containing the Google Scholar ID and determine the Google Scholar ID for the researcher. Ideally (see the extra credit part (e)) we would automate that process and write a Python function that returns the ID, but see Question 5 for why that seemingly would violate Google Scholar’s terms of use.\nCreate a function that constructs the http GET request (and submits that request) to get the citations for the scholar, taking the ID as the input argument and returning the HTML as a Python object.\nIMPORTANT: While running the query in an automated fashion is seemingly allowed (see Problem 5), Google may return “429” errors because it detects automated usage. Here are some things to do in that case:\n\nYou can try to download the HTML file via the UNIX curl command, which you can run within Python as subprocess.run([\"curl\", \"-L\", request_string], capture_output=True). If necessary for part (c), you can use curl or wget from the command line to separately download the file and then read that file into Python.\nWhen developing your code, once you have the code in this part of the problem working to download the HTML, use the downloaded HTML to develop the remainder of your code for part (c) and don’t keep re-downloading the HTML as you work on the remainder of the code.\n\nFor now, you can assume the user will provide a valid ID and that Google Scholar returns a result for the specified person. We’ll deal with making the code more robust in PS2.\nNow write a function that processes the HTML to return a Pandas (or Polars) data frame with the citation information (article title, authors, journal information, year of publication, and number of citations as five columns of information) for the researcher. Try your function on a second researcher to provide more confidence that your function is working properly. (We’ll add unit tests in PS2). Given the comments in (b), ideally your function will work either if given (i) the name of a file that you’ve already downloaded or (ii) the HTML content produced by your function in (b).\nHint: a possibly useful argument for find_all is to request element(s) with certain attributes, e.g., html.find(\"p\", attrs = {'class': 'songtext'}) for finding a p element whose class is songtext.\nCreate a requirements file (based on either pip or Conda) that has the necessary information (in particular Python package versions) to reproduce the environment in which you ran your code. Include this file in your GitHub repository directory for this problem set.\n(Extra credit) If you’d like extra practice, write a Python function that will return the Google Scholar ID when the function is provided an html file as its argument. The file would be the file that is returned by searching for a researcher name as the input at scholar.google.com. As discussed in (a), your function should not query Google Scholar using the requests package, but rather should manipulate an HTML file that you download after manually querying Google Scholar yourself.\n(Extra credit) If you’d like extra practice, fix your function so that you get all of the results for a researcher and not just the first 20. E.g., for Michael Jordan there are several hundred.\n\nLook at the robots.txt for Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) and the references in Unit 2 on the ethics of webscraping. Does it seem like it’s ok to scrape data from Google Scholar? Hopefully this will make clear why our scraping in Problem 4 did not include programmatically obtaining the Google Scholar ID.",

    "text": "Problems\n\nA friend of mine is planning to get married in Death Valley National Park in March (this problem is based on real events…). She wants to hold it as late in March as possible but without having a high chance of a very hot day. This problem will automate the task of generating information about what day of March to hold the wedding using data from the Global Historical Climatology Network. All of your operations should be done using the bash shell except part (c). Also, ALL of your work should be done using shell commands that you save in your solution file. So you can’t say “I downloaded the data from such-and-such website” or “I unzipped the file”; you need to give us the bash code that we could run to repeat what you did. This is partly for practice in writing shell code and partly to enforce the idea that your work should be reproducible and documented.\n\nDownload yearly climate data for a set of years of interest into a temporary directory. Do not download all the years and feel free to focus on a small number of years to reduce the amount of data you need to download. Note that data for Death Valley is only present in the last few decades. As you are processing the files, report the number of observations in each year by printing the information to the screen (i.e., stdout), including if there are no observations for that year.\nSubset to the station corresponding to Death Valley, to the TMAX (maximum daily temperature) variable, and to March, and put all the data into a single file. In subsetting to Death Valley, get the information programmatically from the ghcnd-stations.txt file one level up in the website. Do NOT type in the station ID code when you retrieve the Death Valley data from the yearly files.\nCreate a Python chunk (or R would be fine too) that takes as input your single file from (b) and makes a single plot showing side-by-side boxplots containing the maximum daily temperatures on each calendar day in March. (If you somehow really have trouble mixing Python and bash chunks, it’s ok to insert this figure manually, after running the Python code separately. In this case you could use the jupyter engine provided that a bash kernel is available for Jupyter.)\nNow generalize your code from parts (a) and (b). Write a shell function that takes as arguments a string for identifying the location, the weather variable of interest, and the time period (i.e., the years of interest and the month of interest), and returns the results. Your function should detect if the user provides the wrong number of arguments or a string that doesn’t allow one to identify a single weather station and return a useful error message. It should also give useful help information if the user invokes the function as: get_weather -h. Finally the function should remove the raw downloaded data files (or you should download into your operating system’s temporary file location).\nHint: to check for equality in an if statement, you generally need syntax like:\nif [ \"${var}\" == \"7\" ]\n\nAdd documentation, error-trapping and testing for your code from Problem 4, parts (b) and (c) of PS1. You may use a modified version of your PS1 solution, perhaps because you found errors in what you did or wanted to make changes based on Chris’ solutions (to be distributed in class on Friday Sep. 13) or your discussions with other students. These topics will be covered in Lab 2 (Sep. 13) and are also discussed in Unit 4.\n\nAdd informative doc strings to your functions.\nAdd exceptions for handling run-time errors. You should try to catch the various incorrect inputs a user could provide and anything else that could go wrong (e.g., what happens if the server refuses the request or if one is not online?). In some cases you will want to raise an error, but in others you may want to catch an error with try-except and return None.\nUse the pytest package to set up a thoughtful set of unit tests of your functions.",

    "text": "Problems\n\nMemoization of a function involves storing (caching) the values produced by a given input and then returning the cached result instead of rerunning the function when the same input is provided in the future. It can be a good approach to improve efficiency when a calculation is expensive (and presuming that sometimes the function will be run with inputs on whic it has already been used). It’s particularly useful for for recursive calculuations that involve solving a subproblem in order to solve a given (larger) problem. If you’ve already solved the subproblem you don’t need to solve it again. For example if one is working with graphs or networks, one often ends up writing recursive algorithms. (Suppose, e.g., you have a geneology giving relationships of parents and children. If you wanted to find all the descendants of a person, and you had already found all the descendants of one of the person’s children, you could make use of that without finding the descendants of the child again.)\nWrite a decorator that implements memoization. It should handle functions with either one or two arguments (write one decorator, not two!). You can assume these arguments are simple objects like numbers or strings. As part of your solution, explain whether you need to use nonlocal or not in this case.\nTest your code on basic cases, such as applying the log-gamma function to a number and multiplying together two numbers. These may not be realistic cases, because the lookup process could well take more time than the actual calculation. To assess that, time the memoization approach compared to directly doing the calculation. Be careful that you are getting an accurate timing of such quick calculations (see Unit 5 notes)!\nLet’s work more on how Python stores and copies objects, in particular lists.\n\nExperiment with creating lists of real-valued numbers of different lengths. Try to determine how much memory is used for each reference (each element of the list), not counting the memory used for the actual values. Also consider lists of more complicated objects to see if the behavior is the same or similar.\nUse the list .copy method with a list of numbers and with a list containing more complicated objects (including another list or some dictionary). Compare the behavior in terms of what happens when you modify elements at different levels of nestedness. Relate the behavior to the help information in help(list.copy) and to what we know about how the structure of lists.\nConsider creating these lists.\n\nmy_int = 1\nmy_real = 1.0\nmy_string = 'hat'\n\nxi = [1, my_int, my_int, 2]\nyi = [1, my_int, my_int, 2]\nxr = [1.0, my_real, my_real, 2.0]\nyr = [1.0, my_real, my_real, 2.0]\n\nxc = ['hat', my_string, my_string, 'dog']\nyc = ['hat', my_string, my_string, 'dog']\n\nWhat is different about how the elements in these lists are stored?\n\nSuppose I want to compute the trace of a matrix, \\(A\\), where \\(A=XY\\). The trace is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ii}\\). Assume both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are \\(n \\times n\\). A naive implementation is np.sum(np.diag(X@Y)).\n\nWhat is the computational complexity of that naive implementation: \\(O(n)\\), \\(O(n^2)\\), or \\(O(n^3)\\)? You can just count up the number of multiplications and ignore the additions. Why is that naive implementation inefficient?\nWrite Python code that (much) more eﬀiciently computes the trace using vectorized/matrix operations on the matrices. You will not be able to use map or list comprehension to achieve this speedup. What is the computational complexity of your solution?\nCreate a plot, as a function of \\(n\\), to demonstrate the scaling of the original implementation compared to your improved implementation.\n(Extra credit) Implement your more efficient version in using Jax (see Section 9 of Unit 5) and compare the timing to the numpy implementation, both with and without using jax.jit().\n\nSuppose we have a matrix in which each column is a vector of probabilities that add to one, and we want to generate a sample from the categorical distribution represented by the probabilities in each column. For example, the first column might be (0.9, 0.05, 0.05) and the second column might be (0.1, 0.85, .0.5). When we generate the first sample, it is very likely to be a 1 (a 0 in Python) and the second sample is very likely to be a 2 (a 1 in Python). We could do this using a for loop over the columns of the matrix, and np.random.choice(), but that is a lot slower than some other ways we might do it because it is a loop executing in Python over many elements (columns).\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\nn = 100000\np = 5\n\n# Generate a random matrix and calculate probabilities.\nnp.random.seed(1)\ntmp = np.exp(np.random.randn(p, n))\nprobs = tmp / tmp.sum(axis=0)\n\nsmp = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)\n\n# Generate sample by column.\nnp.random.seed(1)\nstart = time.time()\nfor i in range(n):\n    smp[i] = np.random.choice(p, size=1, p=probs[:,i])[0]\nprint(f\"Loop by column time: {round(time.time() - start, 2)} seconds.\")\n\nLoop by column time: 3.37 seconds.\n\n\n\nConsider transposing the matrix and looping over rows. Why might I hypothesize that this could be faster? Is it faster? Why does it make sense that you got the timing result that you got? Does using numpy’s apply functionality help at all?\nHow can we do it much faster (multiple orders of magnitude), exploiting vectorization? (Hint: This might involve some looping or not, but not in the ways described above. Think about how one can use random uniform numbers to generate from a categorical distribution.)",

This is currently our favorite path due to how well it integrated with the Python debugger.\nUse RStudio (yes, RStudio), which can manage Python code and will display chunk output in the same way it does with R chunks.

In the top-level of your working directory, you should create a file named (exactly) .gitignore.\n\nThe .gitignore file causes Git to ignore transient or computer-specific files that Quarto generates. (more info at https://github.com/github/gitignore) In it, put (again, don’t put dashed lines):\n# cache directories\n/__pycache__\n\n# pickle files\n*.pkl\n*.pickle\n*.csv\nBy adding the pickle and csv extensions you’ll avoid mistakenly committing potentially large data files to your repository.\n\n\nRepository Organization\nThe problem sets in your repository should be organized into folders with specific filenames.\nWhen we pull from your repository, our code will be assuming the following structure:\nyour_repo/\n├── ps1/\n│   ├── ps1.pdf\n│   ├── ps1.qmd \n│   ├── &lt;possibly auxiliary code or other files&gt;\n├── ps2/\n│   ├── ...\n├── ...\n├── ps8/\n└── .gitignore\nThe file names are case-sensitive, so please keep everything lowercase.\n\n\nSave or cache credentials in Git\nIf authenticating to github.berkeley.edu every time sounds inconvenient, note that your credentials can be saved (cached) to avoid entering them constantly. More details can be found on this SCF page. Besides the methods mentioned on the page, one can also store credentials in a file via git config --global credential.helper store.",

    "text": "While R was built/designed for UNIX systems, it has been well adapted for Windows. Here, we’ll start with the basics of installing R on Windows. Then, we’ll cover the recommended editor (Rstudio), and how to build pdf documents using MikTeX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis tutorial installs Windows-only versions of everything. Modern Windows systems have an Ubuntu subsystem available that we highly recommend. See the Installing the Linux Subsystem on Windows tutorial for setting up that configuration.\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nThe first step in installing the R language. This is available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).\n\nGo to the CRAN webpage, www.r-project.org\nIn the first paragraph, click the link download R\nYou’re now on a page titled CRAN Mirrors, choose the mirror located closest to your geographic location\n\nMirrors are different servers that all host copies of the same website. You get best performance from the location closest to you.\n\nYou’re now on a paged titled The Comprehensive R Archive Network. The first box is labeled Downloand and Install R, click Download R for Windows\nClick base or install R for the first time, these take you to the same place\n\nFor more advanced things, you may need the Rtools download later. It isn’t necessary now, but remember that for the future.\n\nAt the top is a large-font link, Download R X.X.X for Windows, click this. It will begin downloading the Windows installer for R.\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\n\n\n\nInstalling RStudio\nRStudio is one of the best text editors for coding in R. It is our recommended option for beginning. After you are comfortable with the language, or if you use other languages as well, you may want to explore Atom or Sublime. More advanced options include Emacs with [ESS package][https://ess.r-project.org/] and vim with the Nvim-R plugin.\nTo install RStudio:\n\nGo to the RStudio Desktop download page, rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nChoose the download for your OS, most likely the Windows 10/8/7 one\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\nOpen RStudio (R will run automatically in the background)\n\nYou may have to allow RStudio to run if prompted (depends on security settings and anti-virus software)\n\n\nOnce RStudio is installed, you can install or update packages in one of two ways:\n\nVia the console, using install.packages() or update.packages()\n\nVia the gui:\n\nIn the top bar, click on tools\nSelect Install Packages… to install packages\nSelect Check for Package Updates… to update packages\n\n\n\n\nCompiling PDF Documents\nFor the purposes of this class, you will be submitting homeworks as PDF documents that blend written text, code, and code-generated output. These documents are RMarkdown documents, and are dynamic documents that provide a convenient method for documenting your work (more on this in one of the lab sections). To do this, you need a LaTeX renderer. We recommend MiKTeX for Windows.\n\nGo to Getting MiKTeX to download MiKTeX for Windows, miktex.org/download\nThe first page should be Install on Windows, click Download at the bottom of the page\n\nClick the download to begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS.\nThe default options are fine in most places, but there is one that will cause problems.\n\n\n\nAccept the Copying Conditions, click next\nInstall only for you, click next\nUse the default directory, click next\nThis should be the Settings page. Under Install missing packages on-the-fly, change the setting to Yes, click next\n\n\n\nBecause we are using MiKTeX as an external renderer, it can’t ask you to install missing packages, and will then fail, so we have to set that installation as automatic.\n\n\nClick start (Optional, but highly recommended) Open RStudio, select a new .Rmd document, d then choose knit. This may take some time, because MiKTeX is installing new braries, but it ensures that your pipeline is setup correctly"

    "text": "Unless you plan to generate your problem set solutions on the SCF, you’ll need to install Quarto.\nOnce installed, you should be able to run commands such as quarto render FILE and quarto preview FILE from the command line.\nTo render to PDF, you’ll need a LaTeX engine installed. A good minimal solution if don’t already have LaTeX installed (e.g., via MicTeX in Windows or MacTeX on MacOS) is to install tinytex: quarto install tinytex.\nQuarto also runs from the Windows Command shell or PowerShell. We’ll add details/troubleshooting tips here (or in the lab 1 materials) as needed.\nquarto convert converts back and forth between the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and Quarto Markdown (.qmd) formats.\nBy default, quarto uses Jupyter to process code chunks. This works well generally, but you can’t have different chunks that use different languages in the same document (e.g., some chunks in Python and some in bash or R). In that case, you can use the R-based knitr package to do the processing. To do so, add engine: knitr to the YAML metadata at the top of the file (if you happen to have an execute stanza, you’ll need to have engine: knitr nested within that stanza). For the knitr engine, you’ll need to have R installed on your computer, with the rmarkdown R package installed. And if you have Python chunks, you’ll also need the reticulate R package.\nFor Python chunks when using the default jupyter engine, if you want all output from multiple commands in a chunk to be printed (without explicitly using print()), you can add the following syntax to the YAML metadata at the top of the file. (Note that, unfortunately, the output will be printed out below the code chunk rather than interspersed with the code, as that is how Jupyter notebooks chunks work.)\nipynb-shell-interactivity: all",
