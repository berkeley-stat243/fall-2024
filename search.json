    "text": "Problems\n\nA friend of mine is planning to get married in Death Valley National Park in March (this problem is based on real events…). She wants to hold it as late in March as possible but without having a high chance of a very hot day. This problem will automate the task of generating information about what day of March to hold the wedding using data from the Global Historical Climatology Network. All of your operations should be done using the bash shell except part (c). Also, ALL of your work should be done using shell commands that you save in your solution file. So you can’t say “I downloaded the data from such-and-such website” or “I unzipped the file”; you need to give us the bash code that we could run to repeat what you did. This is partly for practice in writing shell code and partly to enforce the idea that your work should be reproducible and documented.\n\nDownload yearly climate data for a set of years of interest into a temporary directory. Do not download all the years and feel free to focus on a small number of years to reduce the amount of data you need to download. Note that data for Death Valley is only present in the last few decades. As you are processing the files, report the number of observations in each year by printing the information to the screen (i.e., stdout), including if there are no observations for that year.\nSubset to the station corresponding to Death Valley, to the TMAX (maximum daily temperature) variable, and to March, and put all the data into a single file. In subsetting to Death Valley, get the information programmatically from the ghcnd-stations.txt file one level up in the website. Do NOT type in the station ID code when you retrieve the Death Valley data from the yearly files.\nCreate a Python chunk (or R would be fine too) that takes as input your single file from (b) and makes a single plot showing side-by-side boxplots containing the maximum daily temperatures on each calendar day in March. (If you somehow really have trouble mixing Python and bash chunks, it’s ok to insert this figure manually, after running the Python code separately. In this case you could use the jupyter engine provided that a bash kernel is available for Jupyter.)\nNow generalize your code from parts (a) and (b). Write a shell function that takes as arguments a string for identifying the location, the weather variable of interest, and the time period (i.e., the years of interest and the month of interest), and returns the results. Your function should detect if the user provides the wrong number of arguments or a string that doesn’t allow one to identify a single weather station and return a useful error message. It should also give useful help information if the user invokes the function as: get_weather -h. Finally the function should remove the raw downloaded data files (or you should download into your operating system’s temporary file location).\nHint: to check for equality in an if statement, you generally need syntax like:\nif [ \"${var}\" == \"7\" ]\n\nAdd documentation, error-trapping and testing for your code from Problem 4, parts (b) and (c) of PS1. You may use a modified version of your PS1 solution, perhaps because you found errors in what you did or wanted to make changes based on Chris’ solutions (to be distributed in class on Friday Sep. 13) or your discussions with other students. These topics will be covered in Lab 2 (Sep. 13) and are also discussed in Unit 4.\n\nAdd informative doc strings to your functions.\nAdd exceptions for handling run-time errors. You should try to catch the various incorrect inputs a user could provide and anything else that could go wrong (e.g., what happens if the server refuses the request or if one is not online?). In some cases you will want to raise an error, but in others you may want to catch an error with try-except and return None.\nUse the pytest package to set up a thoughtful set of unit tests of your functions.",

    "text": "Text and binary files\nIn general, files can be divided into text files and binary files. In both cases, information is stored as a series of bits. Recall that a bit is a single value in base 2 (i.e., a 0 or a 1), while a byte is 8 bits.\nA text file is one in which the bits in the file encode individual characters. Note that the characters can include the digit characters 0-9, so one can include numbers in a text file by writing down the digits needed for the number of interest. Examples of text file formats include CSV, XML, HTML, and JSON.\nText files may be simple ASCII files (i.e., files encoded using ASCII) or files in other encodings such as UTF-8, both covered in Section 5. ASCII files have 8 bits (1 byte) per character and can represent 128 characters (the 52 lower and upper case letters in English, 10 digits, punctuation and a few other things – basically what you see on a standard US keyboard). UTF-8 files have between 1 and 4 bytes per character.\nSome text file formats, such as JSON or HTML, are not easily interpretable/manipulable on a line-by-line basis (unlike, e.g., CSV), so they are not as amenable to processing using shell commands.\nA binary file is one in which the bits in the file encode the information in a custom format and not simply individual characters. Binary formats are not (easily) human readable but can be more space-efficient and faster to work with (because it can allow random access into the data rather than requiring sequential reading). The meaning of the bytes in such files depends on the specific binary format being used and a program that uses the file needs to know how the format represents information. Examples of binary files include netCDF files, Python pickle files, R data (e.g., .Rda) files, , and compiled code files.\nNumbers in binary files are usually stored as 8 bytes per number. We’ll discuss this much more in Unit 8.",

    "section": "Common file types",
    "text": "Common file types\nHere are some of the common file types, some of which are text formats and some of which are binary formats.\n\n‘Flat’ text files: data are often provided as simple text files. Often one has one record or observation per row and each column or field is a different variable or type of information about the record. Such files can either have a fixed number of characters in each field (fixed width format) or a special character (a delimiter) that separates the fields in each row. Common delimiters are tabs, commas, one or more spaces, and the pipe (|). Common file extensions are .txt and .csv. Metadata (information about the data) are often stored in a separate file. CSV files are quite common, but if you have files where the data contain commas, other delimiters might be preferable. Text can be put in quotes in CSV files, and this can allow use of commas within the data. This is difficult to deal with from the command line, but read_table() in Pandas handles this situation.\n\nOne occasionally tricky difficulty is as follows. If you have a text file created in Windows, the line endings are coded differently than in UNIX. Windows uses a newline (the ASCII character \\n) and a carriage return (the ASCII character \\r) whereas UNIX uses onlyl a newline in UNIX). There are UNIX utilities (fromdos in Ubuntu, including the SCF Linux machines and dos2unix in other Linux distributions) that can do the necessary conversion. If you see \\^M at the end of the lines in a file, that’s the tool you need. Alternatively, if you open a UNIX file in Windows, it may treat all the lines as a single line. You can fix this with todos or unix2dos.\n\nIn some contexts, such as textual data and bioinformatics data, the data may be in a text file with one piece of information per row, but without meaningful columns/fields.\nData may also be in text files in formats designed for data interchange between various languages, in particular XML or JSON. These formats are “self-describing”; namely the metadata is part of the file. The lxml and json packages are useful for reading and writing from these formats. More in Section 4.\nYou may be scraping information on the web, so dealing with text files in various formats, including HTML. The requests and BeautifulSoup packages are useful for reading HTML.\nIn scientific contexts, netCDF (.nc) (and the related HDF5) are popular format for gridded data that allows for highly-efficient storage and contains the metadata within the file. The basic structure of a netCDF file is that each variable is an array with multiple dimensions (e.g., latitude, longitude, and time), and one can also extract the values of and metadata about each dimension. The netCDF4 package in Python nicely handles working with netCDF files.\nData may already be in a database or in the data storage format of another statistical package (Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). The Pandas package in Python has capabilities for importing Stata (read_stata), SPSS (read_spss), and SAS (read_sas) files, among others.\nFor Excel, there are capabilities to read an Excel file (see the read_excel function in Pandas), but you can also just go into Excel and export as a CSV file or the like and then read that into Python. In general, it’s best not to pass around data files as Excel or other spreadsheet format files because (1) Excel is proprietary, so someone may not have Excel and the format is subject to change, (2) Excel imposes limits on the number of rows, (3) one can easily manipulate text files such as CSV using UNIX tools, but this is not possible with an Excel file, (4) Excel files often have more than one sheet, graphs, macros, etc., so they’re not a data storage format per se.\nPython can easily interact with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.), querying the database using SQL and returning results to Python.

    "text": "CSV vs. specialized formats such as Parquet\nCSV is a common format (particularly in some disciplines/contexts) and has the advantages of being simple to understand, human readable, and readily manipulable by line-based processing tools such as shell commands. However, it has various disadvantages:\n\nstorage is by row, which will often mix values of different types;\nextra space is taken up by explicitly storing commas and newlines; and\none must search through the document to find a given row or value – e.g., to find the 10th row, we must search for the 9th newline and then read until the 10th newline.\n\nA popular file format that has some advantages over plain text formats such as CSV is Parquet. The storage is by column (actually in chunks of columns). This works well with how datasets are often structured in that a given field/variable will generally have values of all the same type and there may be many repeated values, so there are opportunities for efficient storage including compression. Storage by column also allows retrieval only of the columns that a user needs. As a result data stored in the Parquet format often takes up much less space than stored as CSV and can be queried much faster. Also note that data stored in Parquet will often be stored as multiple files.\nHere’s a brief exploration using a data file not in the class repository because of its size but available online here.\n\nimport time\n\n## Read from CSV.\nt0 = time.time()\ndata_from_csv = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'airline.csv'))\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.7721097469329834\n\n\n\n## Write out Parquet-formatted data.\ndata_from_csv.to_parquet(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'airline.parquet'))\n\n## Read from Parquet.\nt0 = time.time()\ndata_from_parquet = pd.read_parquet(os.path.join(\n                                    '..', 'data', 'airline.parquet'))\nprint(time.time() - t0)\n\n0.12245655059814453\n\n\nThe CSV file is 51 MB while the Parquet file is 8 MB.\n\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\", os.path.join(\"..\", \"data\", \"airline.csv\")])\nsubprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\", os.path.join(\"..\", \"data\", \"airline.parquet\")])\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jv.romano grad 51480244 Sep 11 22:28 ../data/airline.csv\n\n\nCompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l', '../data/airline.csv'], returncode=0)\n\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jv.romano grad 8153160 Sep 11 22:31 ../data/airline.parquet\n\n\nCompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l', '../data/airline.parquet'], returncode=0)",

    "text": "Core Python functions\nThe read_table and read_csv functions in the Pandas package are commonly used for reading in data. They read in delimited files (CSV specifically in the latter case). The key arguments are the delimiter (the sep argument) and whether the file contains a header, a line with the variable names. We can use read_fwf() to read from a fixed width text file into a data frame.\nThe most difficult part of reading in such files can be dealing with how Pandas determines the types of the fields that are read in. While Pandas will try to determine the types automatically, it can be safer (and faster) to tell Pandas what the types are, using the dtype argument to read_table().\nLet’s work through a couple examples. Before we do that, let’s look at the arguments to read_table. Note that sep='' can use regular expressions (which would be helpful if you want to separate on any amount of white space, as one example).\n\ndat = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                    sep = ',', header = None)\ndat.dtypes.head()   # 'object' is string or mixed type\ndat.loc[0,1]     \ntype(dat.loc[0,1]) # string!\n## Whoops, there is an 'x', presumably indicating missingness:\ndat.loc[:,1].unique()\n\n0    object\n1    object\n2    object\n3    object\n4    object\ndtype: object\n\n\n'2336'\n\n\nstr\n\n\narray(['2336', '2124', '1830', '1833', '1600', '1578', '1187', '1005',\n       '918', '865', '871', '860', '883', '897', '898', '893', '913',\n       '870', '962', '880', '875', '884', '894', '836', '848', '885',\n       '851', '900', '861', '866', '867', '829', '853', '920', '877',\n       '908', '855', '845', '859', '856', '825', '828', '854', '847',\n       '840', '873', '822', '818', '838', '815', '813', '816', '849',\n       '802', '805', '792', '823', '808', '798', '800', '842', '809',\n       '807', '826', '810', '801', '794', '771', '796', '790', '787',\n       '775', '751', '783', '811', '768', '779', '795', '770', '821',\n       '830', '767', '772', '791', '781', '773', '777', '814', '778',\n       '782', '837', '759', '846', '797', '835', '832', '793', '803',\n       '834', '785', '831', '820', '812', '824', '728', '760', '762',\n       '753', '758', '764', '741', '709', '735', '749', '752', '761',\n       '750', '776', '766', '789', '763', '864', '858', '869', '886',\n       '844', '863', '916', '890', '872', '907', '926', '935', '933',\n       '906', '905', '912', '972', '996', '1009', '961', '952', '981',\n       '917', '1011', '1071', '1920', '3245', '3805', '3926', '3284',\n       '2700', '2347', '2078', '2935', '3040', '1860', '1437', '1512',\n       '1720', '1493', '1026', '928', '874', '833', '850', nan, 'x'],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\n\n## Let's treat 'x' as a missing value indicator.\ndat2 = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                     sep = ',', header = None, na_values = 'x')\ndat2.dtypes.head()\ndat2.loc[:,1].unique()\n\n0     object\n1    float64\n2    float64\n3    float64\n4    float64\ndtype: object\n\n\narray([2336., 2124., 1830., 1833., 1600., 1578., 1187., 1005.,  918.,\n        865.,  871.,  860.,  883.,  897.,  898.,  893.,  913.,  870.,\n        962.,  880.,  875.,  884.,  894.,  836.,  848.,  885.,  851.,\n        900.,  861.,  866.,  867.,  829.,  853.,  920.,  877.,  908.,\n        855.,  845.,  859.,  856.,  825.,  828.,  854.,  847.,  840.,\n        873.,  822.,  818.,  838.,  815.,  813.,  816.,  849.,  802.,\n        805.,  792.,  823.,  808.,  798.,  800.,  842.,  809.,  807.,\n        826.,  810.,  801.,  794.,  771.,  796.,  790.,  787.,  775.,\n        751.,  783.,  811.,  768.,  779.,  795.,  770.,  821.,  830.,\n        767.,  772.,  791.,  781.,  773.,  777.,  814.,  778.,  782.,\n        837.,  759.,  846.,  797.,  835.,  832.,  793.,  803.,  834.,\n        785.,  831.,  820.,  812.,  824.,  728.,  760.,  762.,  753.,\n        758.,  764.,  741.,  709.,  735.,  749.,  752.,  761.,  750.,\n        776.,  766.,  789.,  763.,  864.,  858.,  869.,  886.,  844.,\n        863.,  916.,  890.,  872.,  907.,  926.,  935.,  933.,  906.,\n        905.,  912.,  972.,  996., 1009.,  961.,  952.,  981.,  917.,\n       1011., 1071., 1920., 3245., 3805., 3926., 3284., 2700., 2347.,\n       2078., 2935., 3040., 1860., 1437., 1512., 1720., 1493., 1026.,\n        928.,  874.,  833.,  850.,   nan])\n\n\nUsing dtype is a good way to control how data are read in.\n\ndat = pd.read_table(os.path.join('..', 'data', 'hivSequ.csv'),\n                  sep = ',', header = 0,\n                  dtype = {\n                  'PatientID': int,\n                  'Resp': int,\n                  'PR Seq': str,\n                  'RT Seq': str,\n                  'VL-t0': float,\n                  'CD4-t0': int})\ndat.dtypes\ndat.loc[0,'PR Seq']\n\nPatientID      int64\nResp           int64\nPR Seq        object\nRT Seq        object\nVL-t0        float64\nCD4-t0         int64\ndtype: object\n\n\n'CCTCAAATCACTCTTTGGCAACGACCCCTCGTCCCAATAAGGATAGGGGGGCAACTAAAGGAAGCYCTATTAGATACAGGAGCAGATGATACAGTATTAGAAGACATGGAGTTGCCAGGAAGATGGAAACCAAAAATGATAGGGGGAATTGGAGGTTTTATCAAAGTAARACAGTATGATCAGRTACCCATAGAAATCTATGGACATAAAGCTGTAGGTACAGTATTAATAGGACCTACACCTGTCAACATAATTGGAAGAAATCTGTTGACTCAGCTTGGTTGCACTTTAAATTTY'\n\n\nNote that you can avoid reading in one or more columns by using the usecols argument. Also, specifying the dtype argument explicitly should make for faster file reading.\nIf possible, it’s a good idea to look through the input file in the shell or in an editor before reading into Python to catch such issues in advance. Using the UNIX command less on RTADataSub.csv would have revealed these various issues, but note that RTADataSub.csv is a 1000-line subset of a much larger file of data available from the kaggle.com website. So more sophisticated use of UNIX utilities (as we will see in Unit 3) is often useful before trying to read something into a program.\nIf the file is not nicely arranged by field (e.g., if it has ragged lines), we’ll need to do some more work. We can read each line as a separate string, after which we can process the lines using text manipulation. Here’s an example from some US meteorological data where I know from metadata (not provided here) that the 4-11th values are an identifier, the 17-20th are the year, the 22-23rd the month, etc.\n\nfile_path = os.path.join('..', 'data', 'precip.txt')\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n     lines = file.readlines()\n\nid = [line[3:11] for line in lines]\nyear = [int(line[17:21]) for line in lines]\nmonth = [int(line[21:23]) for line in lines]\nnvalues = [int(line[27:30]) for line in lines]\nyear[0:5]\n\n[2010, 2010, 2010, 2010, 2010]\n\n\nActually, that file, precip.txt, is in a fixed-width format (i.e., every element in a given column has the exact same number of characters),so reading in using pandas.read_fwf() would be a good strategy.",

This can include reading in text from the output of running a shell command and from unzipping a file on the fly.\nHere are some examples of connections:\n\nimport gzip\nwith gzip.open('dat.csv.gz', 'r') as file:\n     lines = file.readlines()\n\nimport zipfile\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('dat.zip', 'r') as archive:\n     with archive.open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n          lines = file.readlines()\n\nimport subprocess\ncommand = \"ls -al\"\noutput = subprocess.check_output(command, shell = True)\n# `output` is a sequence of bytes.\nwith io.BytesIO(output) as stream:  # Create a file-like object.\n    content = stream.readlines()\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.item\", sep=\"\\t\")\n\nIf a file is large, we may want to read it in in chunks (of lines), do some computations to reduce the size of things, and iterate. This is referred to as online processing, streaming, or chunking, and can be done using Pandas (among other tools).\n\nfile_path = os.path.join('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv')\nchunksize = 50 # Obviously this would be much larger in any real application.\n\nwith pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize = chunksize) as reader:\n     for chunk in reader:\n         # manipulate the lines and store the key stuff\n         print(f'Read {len(chunk)} rows.')\n\nMore details on sequential (on-line) processing of large files can be found in the tutorial on large datasets mentioned in the reference list above.\nOne cool trick that can come in handy is to ‘read’ from a string as if it were a text file.

    "text": "Reading HTML\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for displaying content in a web browser. In simple webpages (ignoring the more complicated pages that involve Javascript), what you see in your browser is simply a rendering (by the browser) of a text file containing HTML.\nHowever, instead of rendering the HTML in a browser, we might want to use code to extract information from the HTML.\nLet’s see a brief example of reading in HTML tables.\nNote that before doing any coding, it can be helpful to look at the raw HTML source code for a given page. We can explore the underlying HTML source in advance of writing our code by looking at the page source directly in the browser (e.g., in Firefox under the 3-lines (hamburger) “open menu” symbol, see Web Developer (or More Tools) -&gt; Page Source and in Chrome View -&gt; Developer -&gt; View Source), or by downloading the webpage and looking at it in an editor, although in some cases (such as the nytimes.com case), what we might see is a lot of JavaScript.\nOne lesson here is not to write a lot of your own code to do something that someone else has probably already written a package for.

Then one can search by HTML tag or attribute for information you want using find_all.\nAs another example, it’s often useful to be able to extract the hyperlinks in an HTML document.\n\nURL = \"http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\nsoup = bs(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n## Approach 1: search for HTML 'a' tags.\na_elements = soup.find_all('a')\nlinks1 = [x.get('href') for x in a_elements]\n## Approach 2: search for 'a' elements with 'href' attribute\nhref_elements = soup.find_all('a', href = True)\nlinks2 = [x.get('href') for x in href_elements]\n## In either case, then use `get` to retrieve the `href` attribute value.\n\nlinks2[0:9]\n# help(bs.find_all)\n\n['?C=N;O=D',\n '?C=M;O=A',\n '?C=S;O=A',\n '?C=D;O=A',\n '/pub/data/ghcn/daily/',\n '1750.csv.gz',\n '1763.csv.gz',\n '1764.csv.gz',\n '1765.csv.gz']\n\n\nThe kwargs keyword arguments to find and find_all allow one to search for elements with particular characteristics, such as having a particular attribute (seen above) or having an attribute have a particular value (e.g., picking out an element with a particular id).\nHere’s another example of extracting specific components of information from a webpage (results not shown, since headlines will vary from day to day). We’ll use get_text to retrieve the element’s value.\n\nURL = \"https://dailycal.org\"\nresponse_news = requests.get(URL)\nsoup_news = bs(response_news.content, 'html.parser')\nh2_elements = soup_news.find_all(\"h2\")\nheadlines2 = [x.get_text() for x in h2_elements]\nh3_elements = soup_news.find_all(\"h3\")\nheadlines3 = [x.get_text() for x in h3_elements]\n\nMore generally, we may want to read an HTML document, parse it into its components (i.e., the HTML elements), and navigate through the tree structure of the HTML.\nWe can use CSS selectors with the select method for more powerful extraction capabilities. Going back to the climate data, let’s extract all the th elements nested within tr elements:\n\nsoup.select(\"tr th\")\n\n[&lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=N;O=D\"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=M;O=A\"&gt;Last modified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=S;O=A\"&gt;Size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"?C=D;O=A\"&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th colspan=\"4\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/th&gt;,\n &lt;th colspan=\"4\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/th&gt;]\n\n\nOr we could extract the a elements whose parents are th elements:\n\nsoup.select(\"th &gt; a\")\n\n[&lt;a href=\"?C=N;O=D\"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=M;O=A\"&gt;Last modified&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=S;O=A\"&gt;Size&lt;/a&gt;,\n &lt;a href=\"?C=D;O=A\"&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;]\n\n\nNext let’s use the XPath language to specify elements rather than CSS selectors. XPath can also be used for navigating through XML documents.\n\nimport lxml.html\n\n# Convert the BeautifulSoup object to a lxml object\nlxml_doc = lxml.html.fromstring(str(soup))\n\n# Use XPath to select elements\na_elements = lxml_doc.xpath('//a[@href]')\nlinks = [x.get('href') for x in a_elements]\nlinks[0:9]\n\n['?C=N;O=D',\n '?C=M;O=A',\n '?C=S;O=A',\n '?C=D;O=A',\n '/pub/data/ghcn/daily/',\n '1750.csv.gz',\n '1763.csv.gz',\n '1764.csv.gz',\n '1765.csv.gz']",

    "text": "XML, JSON, and YAML\nXML, JSON, and YAML are three common file formats for storing data. All of them allow for key-value pairs and arrays/lists of unnamed elements and for hierarchical structure.\nTo read them into Python (or other languages), we want to use a package that understands the file format and can read the data into appropriate Python data structures. Usually one ends up with a set of nested (because of the hierarchical structure) lists and dictionaries.\n\nXML\nXML is a markup language used to store data in self-describing (no metadata needed) format, often with a hierarchical structure. It consists of sets of elements (also known as nodes because they generally occur in a hierarchical structure and therefore have parents, children, etc.) with tags that identify/name the elements, with some similarity to HTML. Some examples of the use of XML include serving as the underlying format for Microsoft Office and Google Docs documents and for the KML language used for spatial information in Google Earth.\nHere’s a brief example. The book with id attribute bk101 is an element; the author of the book is also an element that is a child element of the book. The id attribute allows us to uniquely identify the element.\n    &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n    &lt;catalog&gt;\n       &lt;book id=\"bk101\"&gt;\n          &lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;\n          &lt;title&gt;XML Developer's Guide&lt;/title&gt;\n          &lt;genre&gt;Computer&lt;/genre&gt;\n          &lt;price&gt;44.95&lt;/price&gt;\n          &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-10-01&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n          &lt;description&gt;An in-depth look at creating applications with XML.&lt;/description&gt;\n       &lt;/book&gt;\n       &lt;book id=\"bk102\"&gt;\n          &lt;author&gt;Ralls, Kim&lt;/author&gt;\n          &lt;title&gt;Midnight Rain&lt;/title&gt;\n          &lt;genre&gt;Fantasy&lt;/genre&gt;\n          &lt;price&gt;5.95&lt;/price&gt;\n          &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-12-16&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n         &lt;description&gt;A former architect battles corporate zombies, an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen of the world.&lt;/description&gt;\n       &lt;/book&gt;\n    &lt;/catalog&gt;\nWe can read XML documents into Python using various packages, including lxml and then manipulate the resulting structured data object. Here’s an example of working with lending data from the Kiva lending non-profit. You can see the XML format in a browser at http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.xml.\nXML documents have a tree structure with information at nodes. As above with HTML, one can use the XPath language for navigating the tree and finding and extracting information from the node(s) of interest.\nHere is some example code for extracting loan info from the Kiva data. We’ll first show the ‘brute force’ approach of working with the data as a list and then the better approach of using XPath.\n\nimport xmltodict\n\nURL = \"https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.xml\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\ndata = xmltodict.parse(response.content)\ndata.keys()\ndata['response'].keys()\ndata['response']['loans'].keys()\nlen(data['response']['loans']['loan'])\ndata['response']['loans']['loan'][2]\ndata['response']['loans']['loan'][2]['activity']\n\ndict_keys(['response'])\n\n\ndict_keys(['paging', 'loans'])\n\n\ndict_keys(['@type', 'loan'])\n\n\n20\n\n\n{'id': '2845886',\n 'name': 'Elisa Maday',\n 'description': {'languages': {'@type': 'list', 'language': ['es', 'en']}},\n 'status': 'fundraising',\n 'funded_amount': '0',\n 'basket_amount': '0',\n 'image': {'id': '5663896', 'template_id': '1'},\n 'activity': 'Food Production/Sales',\n 'sector': 'Food',\n 'themes': {'@type': 'list',\n  'theme': ['Underfunded Areas', 'Vulnerable Groups']},\n 'use': 'to buy chairs, tables, kitchen utensils, glasses, serving dishes etc.',\n 'location': {'country_code': 'EC',\n  'country': 'Ecuador',\n  'town': 'Machachi',\n  'geo': {'level': 'town', 'pairs': '-0.510726 -78.571763', 'type': 'point'}},\n 'partner_id': '188',\n 'posted_date': '2024-09-12T05:03:42Z',\n 'planned_expiration_date': '2024-10-17T05:03:42Z',\n 'loan_amount': '2000',\n 'borrower_count': '1',\n 'lender_count': '0',\n 'bonus_credit_eligibility': '1',\n 'tags': {'@type': 'list',\n  'tag': [{'name': '#Woman-Owned Business', 'id': '6'},\n   {'name': '#Elderly', 'id': '13'},\n   {'name': '#Supporting Family', 'id': '31'},\n   {'name': '#Biz Durable Asset', 'id': '35'}]}}\n\n\n'Food Production/Sales'\n\n\n\nfrom lxml import etree\ndoc = etree.fromstring(response.content)\n\nloans = doc.xpath(\"//loan\")\n[loan.xpath(\"activity/text()\") for loan in loans]\n\n## suppose we only want the country locations of the loans (using XPath)\n[loan.xpath(\"location/country/text()\") for loan in loans]\n## or extract the geographic coordinates\n[loan.xpath(\"location/geo/pairs/text()\") for loan in loans]\n\n[['Food Market'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Food Production/Sales'],\n ['Food Market'],\n ['Food Market'],\n ['Food'],\n ['Retail'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Charcoal Sales'],\n ['Timber Sales'],\n ['Cattle'],\n ['Clothing Sales'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Agriculture'],\n ['Clothing Sales'],\n ['Fish Selling'],\n ['Farming'],\n ['Food Market'],\n ['Retail'],\n ['Beauty Salon']]\n\n\n[['Liberia'],\n ['Kenya'],\n ['Ecuador'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Sierra Leone'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['El Salvador'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Peru'],\n ['El Salvador'],\n ['Paraguay'],\n ['Kenya'],\n ['Ecuador'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Kenya'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Liberia'],\n ['Liberia']]\n\n\n[['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['0.05 35.716667'],\n ['-0.510726 -78.571763'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['8.636758 -11.472249'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['13.692746 -88.104729'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['-13.518333 -71.978056'],\n ['13.341347 -88.275314'],\n ['-25.39616 -57.536292'],\n ['-0.785561 35.33914'],\n ['-1.94368 -79.065918'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['-1.375081 37.995214'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499'],\n ['6.428055 -9.429499']]\n\n\n\n\nJSON\nJSON files are structured as “attribute-value” pairs (aka “key-value” pairs), often with a hierarchical structure. Here’s a brief example:\n    {\n      \"firstName\": \"John\",\n      \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n      \"isAlive\": true,\n      \"age\": 25,\n      \"address\": {\n        \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n        \"city\": \"New York\",\n        \"state\": \"NY\",\n        \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n      },\n      \"phoneNumbers\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"home\",\n          \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"office\",\n          \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"children\": [],\n      \"spouse\": null\n    }\nA set of key-value pairs is a named array and is placed inside braces (squiggly brackets). Note the nestedness of arrays within arrays (e.g., address within the overarching person array and the use of square brackets for unnamed arrays (i.e., vectors of information), as well as the use of different types: character strings, numbers, null, and (not shown) boolean/logical values. JSON and XML can be used in similar ways, but JSON is less verbose than XML.\nWe can read JSON into Python using the json package. Let’s play again with the Kiva data. The same data that we had worked with in XML format is also available in JSON format: https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.json.\n\nURL = \"https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.json\"\nresponse = requests.get(URL)\n\nimport json\ndata = json.loads(response.text)\ntype(data)\ndata.keys()\n\ntype(data['loans'])\ndata['loans'][0].keys()\n\ndata['loans'][0]['location']['country']\n[loan['location']['country']  for loan in data['loans']]\n\ndict\n\n\ndict_keys(['paging', 'loans'])\n\n\nlist\n\n\ndict_keys(['id', 'name', 'description', 'status', 'funded_amount', 'basket_amount', 'image', 'activity', 'sector', 'themes', 'use', 'location', 'partner_id', 'posted_date', 'planned_expiration_date', 'loan_amount', 'borrower_count', 'lender_count', 'bonus_credit_eligibility', 'tags'])\n\n\n'Liberia'\n\n\n['Liberia',\n 'Kenya',\n 'Ecuador',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Sierra Leone',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Liberia',\n 'El Salvador',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Peru',\n 'El Salvador',\n 'Paraguay',\n 'Kenya',\n 'Ecuador',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Kenya',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Liberia',\n 'Liberia']\n\n\nOne disadvantage of JSON is that it is not set up to deal with missing values, infinity, etc.\n\n\nYAML\nYAML is a similar format commonly used for configuration files that control how code/software/tools behave.\nHere’s an example of the YAML file specifying a GitHub Actions workflow.\nNote the use of indentation (similar to Python) for nesting/hierarchy and the lack of quotation with the strings. This makes it lightweight and readable. Also note the use of arrays/lists and sets of key-value pairs.\n\nimport yaml\n\nwith open(\"book.yml\") as stream:\n   config = yaml.safe_load(stream)  ## `safe_load` avoids running embedded code.\n\nprint(config)\n## How many steps in the `deploy-book` job?\nlen(config['jobs']['deploy-book']['steps'])\n\n{'name': 'deploy-book', True: {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}, 'jobs': {'deploy-book': {'runs-on': 'ubuntu-latest', 'steps': [{'uses': 'actions/checkout@v2'}, {'name': 'Set up Python 3.9', 'uses': 'actions/setup-python@v1', 'with': {'python-version': 3.9}}, {'name': 'Install dependencies', 'run': 'pip install -r book-requirements.txt\\n'}, {'name': 'Build the book', 'run': 'jupyter-book build .\\n'}, {'name': 'GitHub Pages action', 'uses': 'peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3', 'with': {'github_token': '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}', 'publish_dir': './_build/html'}}]}}}\n\n\n5\n\n\nNote that (unfortunately) on is treated as a boolean, as discussed in this GitHub issue for the PyYAML package.",

    "section": "Webscraping and web APIs",
    "text": "Webscraping and web APIs\nHere we’ll see some examples of making requests over the Web to get data. We’ll use APIs to systematically query a website for information. Ideally, but not always, the API will be documented. In many cases that simply amounts to making an HTTP GET request, which is done by constructing a URL.\nThe requests package is useful for a wide variety of such functionality. Note that much of the functionality I describe below is also possible within the shell using either wget or curl.\n\nWebscraping ethics and best practices\nWebscraping is the process of extracting data from the web, either directly from a website or using a web API (application programming interface).\n\nShould you webscrape? In general, if we can avoid webscraping (particularly if there is not an API) and instead directly download a data file from a website, that is greatly preferred.\nMay you webscrape? Before you set up any automated downloading of materials/data from the web you should make sure that what you are about to do is consistent with the rules provided by the website.\n\nSome places to look for information on what the website allows are:\n\nlegal pages such as Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions on the website.\ncheck the robots.txt file (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/robots.txt) to see what a web crawler is allowed to do, and whether the site requires a particular delay between requests to the sites\npotentially contact the site owner if you plan to scrape a large amount of data\n\nHere are some links with useful information:\n\nBlog post on webscraping ethics\nSome information on how to understand a robots.txt file\n\nTips for when you make automated requests:\n\nWhen debugging code that processes the result of such a request, just run the request once, save (i.e., cache) the result, and then work on the processing code applied to the result. Don’t make the same request over and over again.\nIn many cases you will want to include a time delay between your automated requests to a site, including if you are not actually crawling a site but just want to automate a small number of queries.\n\n\n\nWhat is HTTP?\nHTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is a system for communicating information from a server (i.e., the website of interest) to a client (e.g., your laptop). The client sends a request and the server sends a response.\nWhen you go to a website in a browser, your browser makes an HTTP GET request to the website. Similarly, when we did some downloading of html from webpages above, we used an HTTP GET request.\nAnytime the URL you enter includes parameter information after a question mark (www.somewebsite.com?param1=arg1&param2=arg2), you are using an API.\nThe response to an HTTP request will include a status code, which can be interpreted based on this information.\nThe response will generally contain content in the form of text (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON) or raw bytes.\n\n\nAPIs: REST- and SOAP-based web services\nIdeally a web service documents their API (Applications Programming Interface) that serves data or allows other interactions. REST and SOAP are popular API standards/styles. Both REST and SOAP use HTTP requests; we’ll focus on REST as it is more common and simpler. When using REST, we access resources, which might be a Facebook account or a database of stock quotes. The API will (hopefully) document what information it expects from the user and will return the result in a standard format (often a particular file format rather than producing a webpage).\nOften the format of the request is a URL (aka an endpoint) plus a query string, passed as a GET request. Let’s search for plumbers near Berkeley, and we’ll see the GET request, in the form:\nhttps://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=plumbers&find_loc=Berkeley+CA&ns=1\n\nthe query string begins with ?\nthere are one or more Parameter=Argument pairs\npairs are separated by &\n+ is used in place of each space\n\nLet’s see an example of accessing economic data from the World Bank, using the documentation for their API. Following the API call structure, we can download (for example), data on various countries. The documentation indicates that our REST-based query can use either a URL structure or an argument-based structure.\n\n## Queries based on the documentation\napi_url = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/incomeLevel/LIC/country\"\napi_args = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=LIC\"\n\n## Generalizing a bit\nurl = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\ndata = json.loads(response.content)\n\n## Be careful of data truncation/pagination\nif False:\n    url = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json&per_page=1000\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = json.loads(response.content)\n\n## Programmatic control\nbaseURL = \"https://api.worldbank.org/V2/country\"\ngroup = 'MIC'\nformat = 'json'\nargs = {'incomeLevel': group, 'format': format, 'per_page': 1000}\nurl = baseURL + '?' + '&'.join(['='.join(\n                               [key, str(args[key])]) for key in args])\nresponse = requests.get(url)\ndata = json.loads(response.content)\n   \ntype(data)\nlen(data[1])\ntype(data[1][5])\ndata[1][5]\n\nlist\n\n\n105\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{'id': 'BEN',\n 'iso2Code': 'BJ',\n 'name': 'Benin',\n 'region': {'id': 'SSF', 'iso2code': 'ZG', 'value': 'Sub-Saharan Africa '},\n 'adminregion': {'id': 'SSA',\n  'iso2code': 'ZF',\n  'value': 'Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding high income)'},\n 'incomeLevel': {'id': 'LMC',\n  'iso2code': 'XN',\n  'value': 'Lower middle income'},\n 'lendingType': {'id': 'IDX', 'iso2code': 'XI', 'value': 'IDA'},\n 'capitalCity': 'Porto-Novo',\n 'longitude': '2.6323',\n 'latitude': '6.4779'}\n\n\nAPIs can change and disappear. A few years ago, the example above involved the World Bank’s Climate Data API, which I can no longer find!\nAs another example, here we can see the US Treasury Department API, which allows us to construct queries for federal financial data.\nThe Nolan and Temple Lang book provides a number of examples of different ways of authenticating with web services that control access to the service.\nFinally, some web services allow us to pass information to the service in addition to just getting data or information. E.g., you can programmatically interact with your Facebook, Dropbox, and Google Drive accounts using REST based on HTTP POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Authentication is of course important in these contexts and some times you would first authenticate with your login and password and receive a “token”. This token would then be used in subsequent interactions in the same session.\nI created your github.berkeley.edu accounts from Python by interacting with the GitHub API using requests.\n\n\nHTTP requests by deconstructing an (undocumented) API\nIn some cases an API may not be documented or we might be lazy and not use the documentation. Instead we might deconstruct the queries a browser makes and then mimic that behavior, in some cases having to parse HTML output to get at data. Note that if the webpage changes even a little bit, our carefully constructed query syntax may fail.\nLet’s look at some UN data (agricultural crop data). By going to\nhttps://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx?d=FAO, and clicking on “Crops”, we’ll see a bunch of agricultural products with “View data” links. Click on “apricots” as an example and you’ll see a “Download” button that allows you to download a CSV of the data. Let’s select a range of years and then try to download “by hand”. Sometimes we can right-click on the link that will download the data and directly see the URL that is being accessed and then one can deconstruct it so that you can create URLs programmatically to download the data you want.\nIn this case, we can’t see the full URL that is being used because there’s some Javascript involved. Therefore, rather than looking at the URL associated with a link we need to view the actual HTTP request sent by our browser to the server. We can do this using features of the browser (e.g., in Firefox see Web Developer -&gt; Network and in Chrome View -&gt; Developer -&gt; Developer tools and choose the Network tab) (or right-click on the webpage and select Inspect and then Network). Based on this we can see that an HTTP GET request is being used with a URL such as:\nhttp://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc.\nWe’e now able to easily download the data using that URL, which we can fairly easily construct using string processing in bash, Python, or R, such as this (here I just paste it together directly, but using more structured syntax such as I used for the World Bank example would be better):\nHere what is returned is a zip file, which is represented in Python as a sequence of “raw” bytes, so the example code also has some syntax for handling the unzipping and extraction of the CSV file with the data.\n\nimport zipfile\n\n## example URL:\n## https://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;\n##year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&\n##s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\nitemCode = 526\nbaseURL = \"https://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx\"\nyrs = ','.join([str(yr) for yr in range(2012,2018)])\nfilter = f\"?DataFilter=itemCode:{itemCode};year:{yrs}\"\nargs1 = \"&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,3,4,5,6,7&\"\nargs2 = \"s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"\nurl = baseURL + filter + args1 + args2\n## If the website provided a CSV, this would be easier, but it zips the file.\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nwith io.BytesIO(response.content) as stream:  # create a file-like object\n     with zipfile.ZipFile(stream, 'r') as archive:   # treat the object as a zip file\n          with archive.open(archive.filelist[0].filename, 'r') as file:  # get a pointer to the embedded file\n              dat = pd.read_csv(file)\n\ndat.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry or Area\nElement Code\nElement\nYear\nUnit\nValue\nValue Footnotes\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2017.0\nIndex\n202.19\nNaN\n\n\n1\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2016.0\nIndex\n27.45\nNaN\n\n\n2\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2015.0\nIndex\n134.50\nNaN\n\n\n3\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2014.0\nIndex\n138.05\nNaN\n\n\n4\nAfghanistan\n432\nGross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2013.0\nIndex\n138.05\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what have we achieved?\n\nWe have a reproducible workflow we can share with others (perhaps ourself in the future).\nWe can automate the process of downloading many such files.\n\n\n\nMore details on HTTP requests\nA more sophisticated way to do the download is to pass the request in a structured way with named input parameters. This request is easier to construct programmatically.\n\ndata = {\"DataFilter\": f\"itemCode:{itemCode};year:{yrs}\",\n       \"DataMartID\": \"FAO\", \n       \"Format\": \"csv\", \n       \"c\": \"2,3,4,5,6,7\",\n       \"s\": \"countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"\n       }    \n\nresponse = requests.get(baseURL, params = data)\n\nwith io.BytesIO(response.content) as stream:  \n     with zipfile.ZipFile(stream, 'r') as archive:\n          with archive.open(archive.filelist[0].filename, 'r') as file:  \n              dat = pd.read_csv(file)\n\nIn some cases we may need to send a lot of information as part of the URL in a GET request. If it gets to be too long (e.g,, more than 2048 characters) many web servers will reject the request. Instead we may need to use an HTTP POST request (POST requests are often used for submitting web forms). A typical request would have syntax like this search (using requests):\n\nurl = 'http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/advanced/dumper'\n\ndata = {      \"specipes\":\"briggsae\",\n              \"list\": \"\",\n              \"flank3\": \"0\",\n              \"flank5\": \"0\",\n              \"feature\": \"Gene Models\",\n              \"dump\": \"Plain TEXT\",\n              \"orientation\": \"Relative to feature\",\n              \"relative\": \"Chromsome\",\n              \"DNA\":\"flanking sequences only\",\n              \".cgifields\" :  \"feature, orientation, DNA, dump, relative\"\n}                                  \n\nresponse = requests.post(url, data = data)\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(\"POST request successful\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"POST request failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\nUnfortunately that specific search doesn’t work because the server URL and/or API seem to have changed. But it gives you an idea of what the format would look like.\nrequests can handle other kinds of HTTP requests such as PUT and DELETE. Finally, some websites use cookies to keep track of users, and you may need to download a cookie in the first interaction with the HTTP server and then send that cookie with later interactions. More details are available in the Nolan and Temple Lang book.\n\n\nPackaged access to an API\nFor popular websites/data sources, a developer may have packaged up the API calls in a user-friendly fashion as functions for use from Python, R, or other software. For example there are Python (twitter) and R (twitteR) packages for interfacing with Twitter via its API. (Actually, with the change to X, I don’t know if this API is still available.)\nHere’s some example code for Python. This looks up the US senators’ Twitter names and then downloads a portion of each of their timelines, i.e., the time series of their tweets. Note that Twitter has limits on how much one can download at once.\n\nimport json\nimport twitter\n\n# You will need to set the following variables with your\n# personal information.  To do this you will need to create\n# a personal account on Twitter (if you don't already have\n# one).  Once you've created an account, create a new\n# application here:\n#    https://dev.twitter.com/apps\n#\n# You can manage your applications here:\n#    https://apps.twitter.com/\n#\n# Select your application and then under the section labeled\n# \"Key and Access Tokens\", you will find the information needed\n# below.  Keep this information private.\nCONSUMER_KEY       = \"\"\nCONSUMER_SECRET    = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN        = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = \"\"\n\nauth = twitter.oauth.OAuth(OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET,\n                           CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)\napi = twitter.Twitter(auth=auth)\n\n# get the list of senators\nsenators = api.lists.members(owner_screen_name=\"gov\",\n                             slug=\"us-senate\", count=100)\n\n# get all the senators' timelines\nnames = [d[\"screen_name\"] for d in senators[\"users\"]]\ntimelines = [api.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=name, count = 500) \n             for name in names]\n\n# save information out to JSON\nwith open(\"senators-list.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(senators, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\nwith open(\"timelines.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(timelines, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\n\n\n\nAccessing dynamic pages\nMany websites dynamically change in reaction to the user behavior. In these cases you need a tool that can mimic the behavior of a human interacting with a site. Some options are:\n\nselenium is a popular tool for doing this, and there is a Python package of the same name.\nUsing scrapy plus splash is another approach.",

In R one can do something similar with named vectors or named lists or (more efficiently) by using environments.\nIn R, if we are not working with rectangular datasets or standard numerical objects, we often end up using lists or enhanced versions of lists, sometimes with deeply nested structures.\n\nIn Unit 7, we’ll talk about distributed data structures that allow one to easily work with data distributed across multiple computers.",

    "section": "Other kinds of data structures",
    "text": "Other kinds of data structures\nYou may have heard of various other kinds of data structures, such as linked lists, trees, graphs, queues, and stacks. One of the key aspects that differentiate such data structures is how one navigates through the elements.\nSets are collections of elements that don’t have any duplicates (like a mathematical set).\nWith a linked list, with each element (or node) has a value and a pointer (reference) to the location of the next element. (With a doubly-linked list, there is also a pointer back to the previous element.) One big advantage of this is that one can insert an element by simply modifying the pointers involved at the site of the insertion, without copying any of the other elements in the list. A big disadvantage is that to get to an element you have to navigate through the list.\n\n\n\nLinked list (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nBoth trees and graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) and links (edges). A tree involves a set of nodes and links to child nodes (also possibly containing information linking the child nodes to their parent nodes). With a graph, the links might not be directional, and there can be cycles.\n\n\n\nTree (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nA stack is a collection of elements that behave like a stack of lunch trays. You can only access the top element directly(“last in, first out”), so the operations are that you can push a new element onto the stack or pop the top element off the stack. In fact, nested function calls behave as stacks, and the memory used in the process of evaluating the function calls is called the ‘stack’.\nA queue is like the line at a grocery store, behaving as “first in, first out”.\nOne can use such data structures either directly or via add-on packages in Python and R, though I don’t think they’re all that commonly used in R. This is probably because statistical/data science/machine learning workflows often involve either ‘rectangular’ data (i.e., dataframe-style data) and/or mathematical computations with arrays. That said, trees and graphs are widely used.\nSome related concepts that we’ll discuss further in Unit 5 include:\n\ntypes: this refers to how a given piece of information is stored and what operations can be done with the information.\n\n‘primitive’ types are the most basic types that often relate directly to how data are stored in memory or on disk (e.g., booleans, integers, numeric (real-valued), character, pointer (address, reference).\n\npointers: references to other locations (addresses) in memory. One often uses pointers to avoid unnecessary copying of data.\nhashes: hashing involves fast lookup of the value associated with a key (a label), using a hash function, which allows one to convert the key to an address. This avoids having to find the value associated with a specific key by looking through all the keys until the key of interest is found (an O(n) operation).",

You will need to learn more advanced use of git and github towards the end of the semester when you start working with other team members on the same project.\n\nChunk options\nLike RMarkdown, quarto allows for several execution options to be set per document and per chunk. Spend some time getting familiar with the various options, and keep this link handy when you are working on the first few problem sets.\nDepending on what’s required in the problem sets, you may need to set eval to false (just print out code) or error to true (print errors and don’t halt rendering of the document). Some of the other options may be useful for controlling how the code gets printed.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nQuarto succeeds in rendering html but fails at rendering pdf\nInstall tinytex via quarto install tinytex\n\n\nProblems running and rendering bash commands in quarto\nIf you are using the knitr engine, you should be able to tag your code chunks in quarto with {bash} and use verbatim bash commands. If you are using the Jupyter engine, the {python} tag should be used instead and every line containing a bash command should be prefixed with an exclamation mark (!).\n\n\nQuarto rendering (or python execution) works from the terminal but not from the IDE\nYou can go to the settings in your IDE and point it to the specific python installation that you find when you execute which python in the terminal.\n\n\nQuarto rendering (or python execution) works from the IDE but not from the terminal\nyou can fix the quarto configuration by setting the environment variable QUARTO_PYTHON to the correct python path or by running quarto check. Restarting the IDE may also help if you had just installed something in the other environment.\n\n\nPushing to git fails with message “Make sure you configure your ‘user.email’ and ‘user.name’ in git”\nFollow the suggested course of action in the error message to configure your email and name, then push again.",

    "text": "Notes on assignments and activities\n\nOptional library LaTeX session: I highly recommend (in particular if you are a Statistics graduate student) that you know how to create equations in LaTeX. Even if you develop your documents using Quarto, Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, etc. rather than LaTeX-based documents, LaTeX math syntax is the common tool for writing math syntax that will render beautifully.\nOptional Lab 0 software/command line help session: (August 30 in lab room) Help session for installing software, accessing a UNIX-style command line, and basic command line usage (e.g., the UNIX basics tutorial). You can show up at any time (unlike all remaining labs). You should have software installed, be able to accesss the command line, and have started to become familiar with basic command line usage before class on Friday September 6.\nLab 1: (September 6) First section/lab on using Git, setting up your GitHub repository for problem sets, and using Quarto to generate dynamic documents. Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission.\nBash shell tutorial and exercises: (by September 9) Read through this tutorial on using the bash shell. You can skip the pages on Regular Expressions and Managing Processes. Work through the first 10 problems in the exercises and submit your answers via Gradescope. This is not a formal problem set, so you don’t need to worry about formatting nor about explaining/commenting your answers, nor do you need to put your answers in your GitHub class repository. In fact it’s even fine with me if you hand-write the answers and scan them to an electronic document. I just want to make sure you’ve worked through the tutorial. I’ll be doing demonstrations on using the bash shell in class starting on September 6, so that will be helpful as you work through the tutorial.\nRegular expression reading and exercises: (by September 13), read the regular expression material in the tutorial on using the bash shell. Then answer the regular expressions (regex) practice problems and submit your answers on Gradescope. This is not one of the graded problem sets but rather an assignment that will simply be noted as being completed or not.",

You should ask questions about class material and problem sets through the site. Please use this site for your questions so that either or I can respond and so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. I suggest you to modify your settings on Ed Discussion so you are informed by email of postings. In particular you are responsible for keeping track of all course announcements, which we’ll make on the Discussion forum. I strongly encourage you to respond to or comment on each other’s questions as well (this will help your class participation grade), although of course you should not provide a solution to a problem set problem. If you have a specific administrative question you need to direct just to me, it’s fine to email me directly or post privately on the Discussion site. But if you simply want to privately ask a question about content, then just come to an office hour or see me after class or João during/after section.\nIf you’re enrolled in the class you should be a member of the group and be able to access it.

To increase time for discussion and assimilation of the material in class, before some classes I may ask that you read material or work through tutorials in advance of class. Occasionally, I will ask you to submit answers to questions in advance of class as well.\nPlease do not use phones during class and limit laptop use to the material being covered.\nStudent backgrounds with computing will vary. For those of you with limited background on a topic, I encourage you to ask questions during class so I know what you find confusing. For those of you with extensive background on a topic (there will invariably be some topics where one of you will know more about it than I do or have more real-world experience), I encourage you to pitch in with your perspective. In general, there are many ways to do things on a computer, particularly in a UNIX environment and in Python, so it will help everyone (including me) if we hear multiple perspectives/ideas.\nFinally, class recordings for review or to make up for absence will be available through the bCourses Media Gallery, available on the Media Gallery tab on the bCourses page for the class.",

    "text": "Course requirements and grading\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nCampus asks that I include this information about conflicts: Please notify me in writing by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). I will try my best to help you with making accommodations, but I cannot promise them in all cases. In the event there is no mutually-workable solution, you may be dropped from the class.\nThe main conflict that would be a problem would be the quizzes, whose dates I will determine in late August / early September.\nQuizzes are in-person. There is no remote option, and the only make-up accommodations I will make are for illness or serious personal issues. Do not schedule any travel that may conflict with a quiz.\n\n\nCourse grades\nThe grade for this course is primarily based on assignments due every 1-2 weeks, two quizzes (likely in early-mid October and mid-late November), and a final group project. I will also provide extra credit questions on some problem sets. There is no final exam.\n\n50% of the grade is based on the problem sets,\n25% on the quizzes,\n15% on the project, and\n10% on your class participation:\n\nyour responses to the in-class (and occasionally in-advance-of-class) Google forms questions,\ncompletion of occasional non-problem set assignments (including assignments in lab section), and\nsubstantive contribution to discussions on Ed (i.e., responding to your classmates’ questions and asking thoughtful questions about course material).\n\n\nGrades will generally be As and Bs. An A involves doing all the work, getting full credit on most of the problem sets, doing well on the quizzes, and doing a thorough job on the final project.\n\n\nProblem sets\nWe will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or post a question online at the last minute. Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of time for the assignments.\nThere are several rules for submitting your assignments.\n\nYou should prepare your assignments using Quarto.\nProblem set submission consists of both of the following:\n\nA PDF submitted electronically through Gradescope, by the start of class (10 am) on the due date, and\nAn electronic copy of the PDF, code files, and Quarto document pushed to your class GitHub repository, following the instructions to be provided by the GSI.\n\nOn-time submission will be determined based on the time stamp of when the PDF is submitted to Gradescope.\nAnswers should consist of textual response or mathematical expressions as appropriate, with key chunks of code embedded within the document. Function definitions would generally be placed in a separate .py code file. The function definitions and any extensive additional code should be provided as an appendix. Before diving into the code for a problem, you should say what the goal of the code is and your strategy for solving the problem. Raw code without explanation is not an appropriate solution. Please see our qualitative grading rubric for guidance. In general the rubric is meant to reinforce good coding practices and high-quality scientific communication.\nAny mathematical derivations may be done by hand and scanned with your phone if you prefer that to writing up LaTeX equations.\nYou must include a “Collaboration” section in which you indicate any other students you worked with. If you did not collaborate with anyone else, simply state that.\n\nNote: Quarto Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that allows one to embed Python and R code within an HTML document. Please see the SCF dynamics document tutorial; there will be additional information in the first section and on the first problem set.\n\n\nSubmitting assignments\nIn the first section (September 1), we’ll discuss how to submit your problem sets both on Gradescope and via your class GitHub repository, located at https://github.berkeley.edu/&lt;your_calnet_username&gt;.\n\n\nProblem set grading\nThe grading scheme for problem sets is as follows. Each problem set will receive a numeric score for (1) presentation and explanation of results, (2) technical accuracy of code or mathematical derivation, and (3) code quality (style, structure, reproducibility, and creativity). For each of these three components, the possible scores are:\n\n0 = no credit,\n1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all),\n2 = satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you did that didn’t completely/correctly solve or present/explain one or more problems), and\n3 = full credit.\n\nAgain, the qualitative grading rubric provides guidance on what we want to see for full credit.\nFor components #1 and #3, many of you will get a score of 2 for some problem sets as you develop good presentation and coding practices. You can still get an A in the class despite this.\nYour total score for the PS is a weighted sum of the scores for the three components. If you turn in a PS late, I’ll bump you down by two points (out of the available). If you turn it in really late (e.g., after we start grading them), I will bump you down by four points. No credit after solutions are distributed.\n\n\nFinal project\nThe final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4. I’ll assign an overall task, and you’ll be responsible for dividing up the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. You’ll need to use the Git version control system for working in your group.\n\n\nRules for working together and the campus honor code\nI encourage you to work together and help each other out. However, the problem set solutions you submit must be your own. What do I mean by that?\n\nYou should first try to figure out a given problem on your own. After that, if you’re stuck or want to explore alternative approaches or check what you’ve done, feel free to consult with your fellow students and with the GSI and me.\nWhat does “consult with a fellow student mean”? You can discuss a problem with another student, brainstorm approaches, and share code syntax (generally not more than one line) on how to do small individual coding tasks within a problem.\n\nYou should not ask another student for complete code or solutions, or look at their code/solution.\nYou should not share complete code or solutions with another student or on Ed Discussion.\n\nYou may use ChatGPT (or similar chatbots) for help with small sections of a problem (e.g., how to do some specific Python or bash task). You should not use ChatGPT to try to answer an entire question. You should carefully verify that the result is correct.\nYou must provide attribution for ideas obtained elsewhere, including other students and ChatGPT or similar chatbots.\n\nIf you got a specific idea for how to do part of a problem from a fellow student (or some other resource, including ChatGPT), you should note that in your solution in the appropriate place (for specific syntax ideas, note this in a code comment), just as you would cite a book or URL.\nIn addition, you MUST list in a Collaboration section on your problem set solution any fellow students who you worked/consulted with.\nYou do not need to cite any Ed Discussion posts nor any discussions with Chris or João.\n\nUltimately, your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own, and you’ll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else’s.\n\nPlease see the last section of this document for more information on the Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow.",

    "text": "Campus Honor Code\nThe following is the Campus Honor Code. With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding problem sets above – Chris.\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.\nCollaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one’s own independent work.\nCheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.\nPlagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html\nAcademic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional. There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.\nYour experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all.",

Then, we’ll cover the recommended editor (Rstudio), and how to build pdf documents using MikTeX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis tutorial installs Windows-only versions of everything. Modern Windows systems have an Ubuntu subsystem available that we highly recommend. See the Installing the Linux Subsystem on Windows tutorial for setting up that configuration.\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nThe first step in installing the R language. This is available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).\n\nGo to the CRAN webpage, www.r-project.org\nIn the first paragraph, click the link download R\nYou’re now on a page titled CRAN Mirrors, choose the mirror located closest to your geographic location\n\nMirrors are different servers that all host copies of the same website. You get best performance from the location closest to you.\n\nYou’re now on a paged titled The Comprehensive R Archive Network. The first box is labeled Downloand and Install R, click Download R for Windows\nClick base or install R for the first time, these take you to the same place\n\nFor more advanced things, you may need the Rtools download later. It isn’t necessary now, but remember that for the future.\n\nAt the top is a large-font link, Download R X.X.X for Windows, click this. It will begin downloading the Windows installer for R.\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\n\n\n\nInstalling RStudio\nRStudio is one of the best text editors for coding in R. It is our recommended option for beginning. After you are comfortable with the language, or if you use other languages as well, you may want to explore Atom or Sublime. More advanced options include Emacs with [ESS package][https://ess.r-project.org/] and vim with the Nvim-R plugin.\nTo install RStudio:\n\nGo to the RStudio Desktop download page, rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nChoose the download for your OS, most likely the Windows 10/8/7 one\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\nOpen RStudio (R will run automatically in the background)\n\nYou may have to allow RStudio to run if prompted (depends on security settings and anti-virus software)\n\n\nOnce RStudio is installed, you can install or update packages in one of two ways:\n\nVia the console, using install.packages() or update.packages()\n\nVia the gui:\n\nIn the top bar, click on tools\nSelect Install Packages… to install packages\nSelect Check for Package Updates… to update packages\n\n\n\n\nCompiling PDF Documents\nFor the purposes of this class, you will be submitting homeworks as PDF documents that blend written text, code, and code-generated output. These documents are RMarkdown documents, and are dynamic documents that provide a convenient method for documenting your work (more on this in one of the lab sections). To do this, you need a LaTeX renderer. We recommend MiKTeX for Windows.\n\nGo to Getting MiKTeX to download MiKTeX for Windows, miktex.org/download\nThe first page should be Install on Windows, click Download at the bottom of the page\n\nClick the download to begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS.\nThe default options are fine in most places, but there is one that will cause problems.\n\n\n\nAccept the Copying Conditions, click next\nInstall only for you, click next\nUse the default directory, click next\nThis should be the Settings page. Under Install missing packages on-the-fly, change the setting to Yes, click next\n\n\n\nBecause we are using MiKTeX as an external renderer, it can’t ask you to install missing packages, and will then fail, so we have to set that installation as automatic.\n\n\nClick start (Optional, but highly recommended) Open RStudio, select a new .Rmd document, d then choose knit. This may take some time, because MiKTeX is installing new braries, but it ensures that your pipeline is setup correctly"

In some cases we will ask that you put function definitions for more complicated functions into one or more Python code (.py) file(s) and show us the code in the appendix of your main solution file by using inspect.getsource().\nWhy?\n\nFor one or two of the initial problem sets you’ll need to include both bash and Python code. This isn’t possible in a single notebook.\nThe underlying format of .ipynb files is JSON. While this is a plain text format, the key-value pair structure (not generally being aligned with the file lines) is much less well-suited for use with Git version control (which relies on diff) than Markdown-based formats.\nOne can run chunks in a Jupyter notebook in arbitrary order. What is printed to PDF depends on the order in which the chunks are run and the results can differ from what one would expect based on reading the notebook sequentially and running the chunks sequentially. For example, consider the following experiment and you’ll see what I mean: (1) Have one code chunk with a = 3 and run it; (2) Add a second chunk with print(a) and run it; and (3) Change the first chunk to a=4 and DO NOT rerun the second chunk. Save the notebook to PDF. You’ll see that your “report” makes no sense. Here’s the result of me doing that experiment.\n\nIf you really want to do your initial explorations of the problems in a Jupyter notebook, with content then copied to qmd, that is fine.",

    "text": "Problem set solution workflows\nHere we outline a few suggested workflows for developing your problem set solutions:\n\nOpen the qmd file in any editor you like (e.g., Emacs, Sublime, ….). From the command line (we think this will work from a Windows command line such as cmd.exe or PowerShell as well), run quarto preview FILE to show your rendered document live as you edit and save changes. You can put the preview window side by side with your editor, and the preview document should automatically render as you save your qmd file.\nUse VS Code with the following extensions: Python, Quarto, and Jupyter Notebooks. This allows you to execute and preview chunks (and whole document) inside VS Code. This is currently our favorite path due to how well it integrated with the Python debugger.\nUse RStudio (yes, RStudio), which can manage Python code and will display chunk output in the same way it does with R chunks. This path seems to work quite well and is recommended if you are already familiar with RStudio.\n\nLater in the semester, you may be allowed to work directly in Jupyter notebooks and use quarto to render from them directly. This has a few quirks and limitations, but may be allowed for some problem sets.\nPlease commit your work regularly to your repository as you develop your solutions.",

    "text": "Code syntax and style\n\nCoding syntax tips\nThe PEP 8 style guide is your go-to reference for Python style. I’ve highlighted some details here as well as included some general suggestions of my own.\n\nHeader information: put metainfo on the code into the first few lines of the file as comments. Include who, when, what, how the code fits within a larger program (if appropriate), possibly the versions of Python and key packages that you used.\nWrite docstrings for public modules, classes, functions, and methods. For non-public items, a comment after the def line is sufficient to describe the purpose of the item.\nIndentation: Python is strict about indentation of course, which helps to enforce clear indentation more than in other languages. This helps you and others to read and understand the code and can help in detecting errors in your code because it can expose lack of symmetry.\n\nuse 4 spaces per indentation level (avoid tabs if possible).\n\nWhitespace: use it in a variety of places. Some places where it is good to have it are\n\naround operators (assignment and arithmetic);\nbetween function arguments;\nbetween list/tuple elements; and\nbetween matrix/array indices.\n\nUse blank lines to separate blocks of code with comments to say what the block does.\nUse whitespaces or parentheses for clarity even if not needed for order of operations. For example, a/y*x will work but is not easy to read and you can easily induce a bug if you forget the order of ops. Instead, use a/y * x.\nAvoid code lines longer than 79 characters and comment/docstring lines longer than 72 characters.\nComments: add helpful comments (but don’t belabor the obvious, such as x = x + 1  # increment x).\n\nRemember that in a few months, you may not follow your own code any better than a stranger.\nSome key things to document: (1) summarizing a block of code, (2) explaining a very complicated piece of code - recall our complicated regular expressions, and (3) explaining arbitrary constant values.\nComments should generally be complete sentences.\n\nYou can use parentheses to group operations such that they can be split up into lines and easily commented, e.g.,\n\nnewdf = (\n        pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n        .rename(columns = {'STATE': 'us_state'})  # adjust column names\n        .dropna()                                 # remove some rows\n        )\n\nFor software development, break code into separate files (2000-3000 lines per file) with meaningful file names and related functions grouped within a file.\nBeing consistent about the naming style for objects and functions is hard, but try to be consistent. PEP8 suggests:\n\nClass names should be UpperCamelCase.\nFunction, method, and variable names should be snake_case, e.g., number_of_its or n_its.\nNon-public methods and variables should have a leading underscore.\n\nTry to have the names be informative without being overly long.\nDon’t overwrite names of objects/functions that already exist in Python. E.g., don’t use len. That said, the namespace system helps with the unavoidable cases where there are name conflicts.\nUse active names for functions (e.g., calc_loglik, calc_log_lik rather than loglik or loglik_calc). The idea is that a function in a programming language is like a verb in regular language (a function does something), so use a verb to name it.\nLearn from others’ code\n\nThis semester, someone will be reading your code - the GSI and and me when we look at your assignments. So to help us in understanding your code and develop good habits, put these ideas into practice in your assignments.\nWhile not Python examples, the files goodCode.R and badCode.R in the units directory of the class repository provide examples of R code written such that it does and does not conform to the general ideas listed above (leaving aside the different syntax of Python and R).\n\n\nCoding style suggestions\nThis is particularly focused on software development, but some of the ideas are useful for data analysis as well.\n\nBreak down tasks into core units.\nWrite reusable code for core functionality and keep a single copy of the code (using version control) so you only need to make changes to a piece of code in one place.\nSmaller functions are easier to debug, easier to understand, and can be combined in a modular fashion (like the UNIX utilities).\nWrite functions that take data as an argument and not lines of code that operate on specific data objects. Why? Functions allow us to reuse blocks of code easily for later use and for recreating an analysis (reproducible research). It’s more transparent than sourcing a file of code because the inputs and outputs are specified formally, so you don’t have to read through the code to figure out what it does.\nFunctions should:\n\nbe modular (having a single task);\nhave meaningful name; and\nhave a doc string describing their purpose, inputs and outputs.\n\nWrite tests for each function (i.e., unit tests).\nDon’t hard code numbers - use variables (e.g., number of iterations, parameter values in simulations), even if you don’t expect to change the value, as this makes the code more readable. For example, the speed of light is a constant in a scientific sense, but best to make it a variable in code: speed_of_light = 3e8.\nUse lists or tuples to keep disparate parts of related data together.\nPractice defensive programming (see also the discussion below on raising exceptions and assertions):\n\ncheck function inputs and warn users if the code will do something they might not expect or makes particular choices;\ncheck inputs to if:\n\nNote that in Python, an expression used as the condition of an if will be equivalent to True unless it is one of False, 0, None, or an empty list/tuple/string.\n\nprovide reasonable default arguments;\ndocument the range of valid inputs;\ncheck that the output produced is valid; and\nstop execution based on checks and give an informative error message.\n\nTry to avoid system-dependent code that only runs on a specific version of an OS or specific OS.\nLearn from others’ code.\nAsk others to review your code and help by reviewing other people’s code.\nConsider rewriting your code once you know all the settings and conditions; often analyses and projects meander as we do our work and the initial plan for the code no longer makes sense and the code is no longer designed specifically for the job being done.\n\n\n\nLinting\nLinting is the process of applying a tool to your code to enforce style.\nHere we’ll see how to use ruff. You might also consider black.\nWe’ll practice with ruff with a small module we’ll use next also for debugging.\nFirst, we check for and fix syntax errors.\nruff check test.py\nAll checks passed!\nThen we ask ruff to reformat to conform to standard style.\ncp test.py test-save.py   # Not required, just so we can see what `ruff` did.\nruff format test.py\n1 file reformatted\nLet’s see what changed:\ndiff test-save.py test.py\n1c1\n&lt; x=  7\n---\n&gt; x = 7\n3,5d2\n&lt; def myfun(x, y =0):\n&lt; # This is a toy function.\n&lt;       return x*y\n6a4,6\n&gt; def myfun(x, y=0):\n&gt;     # This is a toy function.\n&gt;     return x * y\nSo we see that ruff fixed spacing and properly indented the comment line.",

    "section": "Assertions, exceptions and testing",
    "text": "Assertions, exceptions and testing\nAssertions, exceptions and testing are critically important for writing robust code that is less likely to contain bugs.\n\nExceptions\nYou’ve probably already seen exceptions in action whenever you’ve done something in Python that causes an error to occur and an error message to be printed. Syntax errors are different from exceptions in that exceptions occur when the syntax is correct, but the execution of the code results in some sort of error (i.e., a run-time error).\nExceptions can be a valuable tool for making your code handle different modes of failure (missing file, URL unreachable, permission denied, invalid inputs, etc.). You use them when you are writing code that is supposed to perform a task (e.g., a function that does something with an input file) to indicate that the task failed and the reason for that failure (e.g., the file was not there in the first place). In such a case, you want your code to raise an exception and make the error message informative as possible, typically by handling the exception thrown by another function you call and augmenting the message. Another possibility is that your code detects a situation where you need to throw an exception (e.g., an invalid input to a function).\nThe other side of the coin happens when you want to write a piece of code that handles failure in a specific way, instead of simply giving up. For example, if you are writing a script that reads and downloads hundreds of URLs, you don’t want your program to stop when any of them fails to respond (or do you?). You might want to continue with the rest of the URLs, and write out the failed URLs in a secondary output file.\n\nUsing try-except to continue execution\nIf you want some code to continue running even when it encounters an error, you can use try-except. This would often be done in code where you were running some workflow, but can also be useful in functions that you write for general purpose use (e.g., code in a package you are writing).\nSuppose we have a loop and we want to run all the iterations even if the code for some iterations fail. We can embed the code that might fail in a try block and then in the except block, run code that will handle the situation when the error occurs.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    try:\n        &lt;some code that might fail&gt;\n        result[i] = &lt;actual result&gt;\n    except:\n        &lt;what to do if the code fails&gt;\n        result[i] = None   \n\n\n\nStrategies for invoking and handling errors\nHere we’ll address situations that might arise when you are developing code for general purpose use (e.g., writing functions in a package) and need that code to invoke an error under certain circumstances or deal gracefully with an error occurring in some code that you are calling.\nA basic situation is when you want to detect a situation where you need to invoke an error (i.e., “throw an exception”).\nWith raise you can invoke an exception. Suppose we need an input to be a positive number. We’ll use Python’s built-in ValueError, one of the various exception types that Python provides and that you could use. You can also create your own exceptions by subclassing one of Python’s existing exception classes. (We haven’t yet discussed classes and object-oriented programming, so don’t worry if you’re not sure about what that means.)\n\ndef myfun(val):\n    if val &lt;= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"`val` should be positive\")\n\nmyfun(-3)\n\nValueError: `val` should be positive\nNext let’s consider cases where your function runs some code that might return an error.\nWe’d often want to catch the error using try-except. In some cases we would want to notify the user and then continue (perhaps falling back to a different way to do things or returning None from our function) while in others we might want to provide a more informative error message than if we had just let the error occur, but still have the exception be raised.\nFirst let’s see the case of continuing execution.\n\nimport os\n\ndef myfun(filename):\n    try:\n        with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n            text = file.read()\n    except Exception as err:\n        print(f\"{err}\\nCheck that the file `{filename}` can be found \"\\\n              f\"in the current path: `{os.getcwd()}`.\")\n        return None\n\n    return(text.lower())\n\n\nmyfun('missing_file.txt')\n\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'missing_file.txt'\nCheck that the file `missing_file.txt` can be found in the current path: `/accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units`.\nFinally let’s see how we can intercept an error but then “re-raise” the error rather than continuing execution.\n\nimport requests\n\ndef myfun(url):\n    try:\n        requests.get(url)\n    except Exception as err:\n        print(f\"There was a problem accessing {url}. \"\\\n              f\"Perhaps it doesn't exist or the URL has a typo?\")\n        raise\n\nmyfun(\"http://missingurl.com\")\n\nThere was a problem accessing http://missingurl.com. Perhaps it doesn't exist or the URL has a typo?\n\nConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='missingurl.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f348db44590&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))\n\n\n\nAssertions\nAssertions are a quick way to raise a specific type of Exception (AssertionError). Assertions are useful for performing quick checks in your code that the state of the program is as you expect. They’re primarily intended for use during the development process to provide “sanity checks” that specific conditions are true, and there are ways to disable them when you are running your code for production purposes (to improve performance). A common use is for verifying preconditions and postconditions (especially preconditions). One would generally only expect such conditions not to be true if there is a bug in the code. Here’s an example of using the assert statement in Python, with a clear assertion message telling the developer what the problem is.\n\nnumber = -42\nassert number &gt; 0, f\"number greater than 0 expected, got: {number}\"\n## Produces this error:\n## Traceback (most recent call last):\n##   File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n## AssertionError: number greater than 0 expected, got: -42\n\nVarious operators/functions are commonly used in assertions, including\n\nassert x in y\nassert x not in y\nassert x is y\nassert x is not y\nassert isinstance(x, &lt;some_type&gt;)\nassert all(x)\nassert any(x)\n\nAssertions can also be quite useful in the context of data analysis pipelines for checking that the state of the analysis is as expected. E.g., at various points, you might check that the dimension of your data is as expected, check for missing or extreme/unexpected values, etc.\nNext we’ll see that assertions are a core part of setting up tests.\n\n\nTesting\nTesting is informally what you do after you write some code and want to check that it actually works. But when you are developing important code (e.g. functions that are going to be used by others) you typically want to encode your tests in code. There are many reasons to do that, including making sure that if anyone changes the code later on and breaks something, the test suite should immediately indicate that.\nSome people even advocate for writing a preliminary test suite before writing the code itself(!) as it can be a good way to organize work and track progress, as well as act as a secondary form of documentation for clarity. This can include tests that your code provides correct and useful errors when something goes wrong (so that means that a test might be to see if problematic input correctly produces an error). Unit tests are intended to test the behavior of small pieces (units) of code, generally individual functions. Unit tests naturally work well with the ideas above of writing small, modular functions. I recommend the pytest package, which is designed to make it easier to write sets of good tests.\nHere is an example of the contents of a test file, called test_dummy.py.\n\nimport pytest\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport dummy\n\ndef test_numeric():\n    assert dummy.add_one(3) == 4\n\n# This test will fail.\ndef test_numpy_array():\n    assert np.all(np.equal(dummy.add_one(np.array([3,4])), np.array([4,5])))\n\ndef test_bad_input():\n    with pytest.raises(TypeError):\n        dummy.add_one('hello')\n\ndef test_warning():\n    with pytest.warns(UserWarning, match='complex'):\n        dummy.add_one(1+3j)\n\nWe can then run the tests via pytest like this:\npytest mytestfile.py\n====================================== test session starts ======================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-8.1.1, pluggy-1.4.0\nrootdir: /accounts/vis/paciorek/teaching/243fall24/fall-2024/units\nplugins: anyio-4.3.0\ncollected 4 items                                                                               \n\ntest_dummy.py .F..

The most common kind of CI is automated testing - running your tests on your code when you make changes to the code. This enforces the discipline of running tests regularly and avoids the common problem that testing passes locally on your own machine, but fails for various reasons when done elsewhere.\nA standard way to do this is via GitHub Actions (GHA).\nTo set up a GitHub Actions workflow, one\n\nspecifies when the workflow will run (e.g., when a push or pull request is made, or only manually)\nprovides instructions for how to set up the environment for the workflow\nprovides the operations that the workflow should run.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a YAML file placed in the .github/workflows directory of the repository.\nWith GHA, you specify the operating system and then the steps to run in the YAML file. Some steps will customize the environment as the initial steps and then additional step(s) will run shell or other code to run your workflow. You use pre-specified operations (called actions) to do common things (such as checking out a GitHub repository and installing commonly used software).\nWhen triggered, GitHub will run the steps in a virtual machine, which is called the runner.\nHere’s an example YAML file for testing an example package called mytoy:\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - main\n\njobs:\n  CI:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    # Install package and dependencies\n    - name: Set up Python \n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: 3.12\n\n    - name: Install mytoy and pytest\n      run: |\n        pip install pytest\n        pip install --user .\n\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: |\n        cd mytoy\n        pytest\nYou’ll use GitHub Actions to automate testing during your projects. Unfortunately, GitHub Actions is not available via github.berkeley.edu so we can’t use it with your class repositories for your problem set work.",

    "text": "Basic debugging strategies\nHere we’ll discuss some basic strategies for finding and fixing bugs. Other useful locations for tips on debugging include:\n\nEfficient Debugging by Goldspink\nDebugging for Beginners by Brody\n\nRead and think about the error message (the traceback), starting from the bottom of the traceback. Sometimes it’s inscrutable, but often it just needs a bit of deciphering. Looking up a given error message by simply doing a web search with the exact message in double quotes can be a good strategy, or you could look specifically on Stack Overflow.\nBelow we’ll see how one can view the stack trace. Usually when an error occurs, it occurs in a function call that is nested in a series of function calls. This series of calls is the call stack and the traceback or stack trace shows that series of calls that led to the error. To debug, you’ll often need to focus on the function being executed at the time the error occurred (which will be at the top of the call stack but the bottom of the traceback) and the arguments passed into that function. However, if the error occurs in a function you didn’t write, the problem will often be with the arguments that your code provided at the last point in the call stack at which code that you wrote was run. Check the arguments that your code passed into that first function that is not a function of yours.\nWhen running code that produces multiple errors, fix errors from the top down - fix the first error that is reported, because later errors are often caused by the initial error. It’s common to have a string of many errors, which looks daunting, caused by a single initial error.\nIs the bug reproducible - does it always happen in the same way at at the same point? It can help to restart Python and see if the bug persists - this can sometimes help in figuring out if there is a scoping issue and we are using a global variable that we did not mean to.\nIf you can’t figure out where the error occurs based on the error messages, a basic strategy is to build up code in pieces (or tear it back in pieces to a simpler version). This allows you to isolate where the error is occurring. You might use a binary search strategy. Figure out which half of the code the error occurs in. Then split the ‘bad’ half in half and figure out which half the error occurs in. Repeat until you’ve isolated the problem.\nIf you’ve written your code modularly with lots of functions, you can test individual functions. Often the error will be in what gets passed into and out of each function.\nAt the beginning of time (the 1970s?), the standard debugging strategy was to insert print statements in one’s code to see the value of a variable and thereby decipher what could be going wrong. We have better tools nowadays. But sometimes we still need to fall back to inserting print statements.\nPython is a scripting language, so you can usually run your code line by line to figure out what is happening. This can be a decent approach, particularly for simple code. However, when you are trying to find errors that occur within a series of many nested function calls or when the errors involve variable scoping (how Python looks for variables that are not local to a function), or in other complicated situations, using formal debugging tools can be much more effective. Finally, if the error occurs inside of functions provided by Python, rather than ones you write, it can be hard to run the code in those functions line by line.",

    "text": "Tips for avoiding bugs and catching errors\n\nPractice defensive programming\nWhen writing functions, and software more generally, you’ll want to warn the user or stop execution when there is an error and exit gracefully, giving the user some idea of what happened. Here are some things to consider:\n\ncheck function inputs and warn users if the code will do something they might not expect or makes particular choices;\ncheck inputs to if and the ranges in for loops;\nprovide reasonable default arguments;\ndocument the range of valid inputs;\ncheck that the output produced is valid; and\nstop execution based on assertions, try or raise with an informative error message.\n\nHere’s an example of building a robust square root function:\n\nimport warnings\n\ndef mysqrt(x):\n    if isinstance(x, str):\n        raise TypeError(f\"What is the square root of '{x}'?\")\n    if isinstance(x, (float, int)):\n        if x &lt; 0:\n            warnings.warn(\"Input value is negative.\", UserWarning)\n            return float('nan')   # Avoid complex number result.\n        else:\n            return x**0.5\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Cannot take the square root of {x}\")\n\n\nmysqrt(3.1)\nmysqrt(-3)\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_1958805/18181922.py:8: UserWarning:\n\nInput value is negative.\n\n\n\nnan\n\n\n\nmysqrt('hat')\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 3, in mysqrt\nTypeError: What is the square root of 'hat'?\n\n\nCatch run-time errors with try/except statements\nAlso, sometimes a function you call will fail, but you want to continue execution. For example, consider the stratified analysis show previously in which you take subsets of your data based on some categorical variable and fit a statistical model for each value of the categorical variable. If some of the subsets have no or very few observations, the statistical model fitting might fail. To do this, you might be using a for loop or apply. You want your code to continue and fit the model for the rest of the cases even if one (or more) of the cases cannot be fit.

In this example, we could have checked the sample size for the subset before doing the regression, but in other contexts, we may not have an easy way to check in advance whether the function call will fail.\n\n\nMaintain dimensionality\nPython (usually helpfully) drops array dimensions that are extraneous. This can sometimes confuse later code that expects an object of a certain dimension. Here’s a work-around:\n\nimport numpy as np\nmat = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nnp.sum(mat, axis=0)         # This sums columns, as desired\n\nrow_subset = 1\nmat2 = mat[row_subset, :]\nnp.sum(mat2, axis=0)        # This sums the elements, not the columns.\n\nif len(mat2.shape) != 2:    # Fix dimensionality.\n    mat2 = mat2.reshape(1, -1)\n\n\nnp.sum(mat2, axis=0)   \n\narray([3, 4])\n\n\nIn this simple case it’s obvious that a dimension will be dropped, but in more complicated settings, this can easily occur for some inputs without the coder realizing that it may happen. Not dropping dimensions is much easier than putting checks in to see if dimensions have been dropped and having the code behave differently depending on the dimensionality.\n\n\nFind and avoid global variables\nIn general, using global variables (variables that are not created or passed into a function) results in code that is not robust. Results will change if you or a user modifies that global variable, usually without realizing/remembering that a function depends on it.\nOne ad hoc strategy is to remove objects you don’t need from Python’s global scope, to avoid accidentally using values from an old object via Python’s scoping rules. You can also run your function in a fresh session to see if it’s unable to find variables.\n\ndel x   # Mimic having a fresh sesson (knowing in this case `x` is global).\n\ndef f(z):\n    y = 3\n    print(x + y + z)\n\ntry:\n    f(2)\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(error)\n\nname 'x' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous tips\n\nUse core Python functionality and algorithms already coded. Figure out if a functionality already exists in (or can be adapted from) an Python package (or potentially in a C/Fortran library/package): code that is part of standard mathematical/numerical packages will probably be more efficient and bug-free than anything you would write.\nCode in a modular fashion, making good use of functions, so that you don’t need to debug the same code multiple times. Smaller functions are easier to debug, easier to understand, and can be combined in a modular fashion (like the UNIX utilities).\nWrite code for clarity and accuracy first; then worry about efficiency. Write an initial version of the code in the simplest way, without trying to be efficient (e.g., you might use for loops even if you’re coding in Python); then make a second version that employs efficiency tricks and check that both produce the same output.\nPlan out your code in advance, including all special cases/possibilities.\nWrite tests for your code early in the process.\nBuild up code in pieces, testing along the way. Make big changes in small steps, sequentially checking to see if the code has broken on test case(s).\nBe careful that the conditions of if statements and while loops and the sequences of for loops are robust.\nDon’t hard code numbers - use variables (e.g., number of iterations, parameter values in simulations), even if you don’t expect to change the value, as this makes the code more readable and reduces bugs when you use the same number multiple times; e.g. speed_of_light = 3e8 or n_its = 1000.\n\nIn a future Lab, we’ll go over debugging in detail.\n\n\nCode review\nIt’s a good idea to have others review your code, ideally during the development process.\nThis article provides guidance on good practices for code review.",

Save the output of the pre-processing as data file(s) that can be read in to the analysis script.\nYou may want to name your files something like this, so there is an obvious ordering: “1-prep.py”, “2-analysis.py”, “3-figs.py”.\nHave the code file for the figures produce the exact manuscript/report figures, operating on a file (e.g., a pickle file) that contains all the objects necessary to run the figure-producing code; the code producing the pickle file should be in your analysis code file (or somewhere else sensible).\nAlternatively, use Quarto or Jupyter notebooks for your document preparation.\n\nKeep a document describing your running analysis with dates in a text file (i.e., a lab book).\nNote where data were obtained (and when, which can be helpful when publishing) and pre-processing steps in the lab book. Have data version numbers with a file describing the changes and dates (or in lab book). If possible, have all changes to data represented as code that processes the data relative to a fixed baseline dataset.\nNote what code files do what in the lab book.\nKeep track of the details of the system and software you are running your code under, e.g., operating system version, software (e.g., Python, R) versions, Python or R package versions, etc.\n\npip list and conda list will show you version numbers for installed packages.\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt and conda env export &gt; env.yml will create a recipe file for your environment.\npip install -r requirements.txt and conda env create -f env.yml will build that environment on your machine.",

Alternatively, one can use the make tool, which is generally used for compiling code, as a tool for reproducible research: if interested, see the tutorial on Using make for workflows or this Journal of Statistical Software article for more details.\nYou might organize your workflow as a Python or R package as described (for the R case) in this article.\nPackage management:\n\nPython: You can manage the versions of Python packages (and dependent packages) used in your project using Conda environments (or virtualenvs).\nR: You can manage the versions of R packages (and dependent packages) used in your project using package management packages such as renv and packrat. Unfortunately, the useful checkpoint package relies on snapshots of CRAN that are not available after January 2023.\n\nIf your project uses multiple pieces of software (e.g., not just Python or R), you can set up a reproducible environment using containers, of which Docker containers are the best known. These provide something that is like a lightweight virtual machine in which you can install exactly the software (and versions) you want and then share with others. Docker container images are a key building block of various tools such as GitHub Actions and the Binder project.

Please see the grading rubric, and note that the output should be produced as a result of the code chunks being run during the rendering process, not by copy-pasting of output from running the code separately (and definitely not as screenshots).",

    "text": "Problems\n\nPlease read these lecture notes about how computers work, used in a class on statistical computing at CMU. Briefly (a few sentences) describe the difference between disk and memory based on that reference and/or other resources you find.\nThis problem uses the ideas and tools in Unit 2, Sections 1-3 to explore approaches to reading and writing data from files and to consider file sizes in ASCII plain text vs. binary formats in light of the fact that numbers are (generally) stored as 8 bytes per number in binary formats.\n\nGenerate a numpy array (named x) of random numbers from a standard normal distribution with 20 columns and as many rows as needed so that the data take up about 16 MB (megabytes) in size. As part of your answer, show the arithmetic (formatted using LaTeX math syntax) you did to determine the number of rows.\nExplain the sizes of the two files created below. In discussing the CSV text file, how many characters do you expect to be in the file (i.e., you should be able to estimate this reasonably accurately from first principles without using wc or any explicit program that counts characters). Hint: what do we know about numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution?\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nx = x.round(decimals = 12)\n\npd.DataFrame(x).to_csv('x.csv', header = False, index = False)\nprint(f\"{str(os.path.getsize('x.csv')/1e6)} MB\")\n\npd.DataFrame(x).to_pickle('x.pkl', compression = None) \nprint(f\"{str(os.path.getsize('x.pkl')/1e6)} MB\")\n\n30.777355 MB\n16.000572 MB\n\n\nSuppose we had rounded each number to four decimal places. Would using CSV have saved disk space relative to the pickle file?\nNow consider saving out the numbers one number per row in a CSV file. Given we no longer have to save all the commas, why is the file size unchanged?\nRead the CSV file into Python using pandas.read_csv. Compare the speed of reading the CSV to reading the pickle file with pandas.read_pickle. Note that in some cases you might find that the first time you read a file is slower; if so this has to do with the operating system caching the file in memory (we’ll discuss this further in Unit 7 when we talk about databases).\nFinally, in the next parts of the question, we’ll consider reading the CSV file in chunks as discussed in Unit 2. First, time how long it takes to read the first 10,000 rows in a single chunk using nrows.\nNow experiment with the skiprows to see if you can read in a large chunk of data from the middle of the file as quickly as the same size chunk from the start of the file. What does this indicate regarding whether Pandas/Python has to read in all the data up to the point where the chunk in the middle starts or can skip over it in some fashion? Is there any savings relative to reading all the initial rows and the chunk in the middle all at once?\n\nPlease read the Code syntax and style section of Unit 4 on good programming/project practices and incorporate what you’ve learned from that reading into your solution for Problem 4. (You can skip the section on Assertions and Testing, as we’ll cover that in Lab.) In particular, lint your code (e.g., using ruff or another tool of your choice as discussed in the Unit 4. (This is most straightforward for code in a .py file. If your code is directly in the qmd file, you probably need to copy-paste it into another file to lint it, unfortunately. If anyone figures out a good way to directly lint the code chunks, please post on Ed!)\nAs your response to this question, very briefly (a few sentences) note what you did in your code for Problem 4 that reflects what you read. Please also note anything in what you read in Unit 4 that you disagree with, if you have a different stylistic perspective.\nWe’ll experiment with webscraping and manipulating HTML by getting publication information off of Google Scholar. Note that Google Scholar does not have an API, so we are forced to deconstruct the queries that are produced when we point and click on the website.\nYour functions may be short enough that it’s ok to put a function directly within a code chunk in your qmd file. Or you might choose to put one or more functions into a .py file and use inspect.getsource() to show us the code. For this problem in which the focus of the work is the function and how it works, it will generally be best to show the function code as part of the problem solution rather than in an appendix.\n\nGo to Google Scholar and enter the name (including first name to help with disambiguation) for a researcher whose work interests you. (If you want to do the one that will match the problem set solutions, you can use “Michael Jordan”, who is a well-known statistician and machine learning researcher here at Berkeley.) If you’ve entered the name of a researcher that Google Scholar recognizes as having a Google Scholar profile, you should see that the first item shown in the results page is a “User profile”. Now, based on the information returned, show the HTML element containing the Google Scholar ID and determine the Google Scholar ID for the researcher. Ideally (see the extra credit part (e)) we would automate that process and write a Python function that returns the ID, but see Question 5 for why that seemingly would violate Google Scholar’s terms of use.\nCreate a function that constructs the http GET request (and submits that request) to get the citations for the scholar, taking the ID as the input argument and returning the HTML as a Python object.\nIMPORTANT: While running the query in an automated fashion is seemingly allowed (see Problem 5), Google may return “429” errors because it detects automated usage. Here are some things to do in that case:\n\nYou can try to download the HTML file via the UNIX curl command, which you can run within Python as subprocess.run([\"curl\", \"-L\", request_string], capture_output=True). If necessary for part (c), you can use curl or wget from the command line to separately download the file and then read that file into Python.\nWhen developing your code, once you have the code in this part of the problem working to download the HTML, use the downloaded HTML to develop the remainder of your code for part (c) and don’t keep re-downloading the HTML as you work on the remainder of the code.\n\nFor now, you can assume the user will provide a valid ID and that Google Scholar returns a result for the specified person. We’ll deal with making the code more robust in PS2.\nNow write a function that processes the HTML to return a Pandas (or Polars) data frame with the citation information (article title, authors, journal information, year of publication, and number of citations as five columns of information) for the researcher. Try your function on a second researcher to provide more confidence that your function is working properly. (We’ll add unit tests in PS2). Given the comments in (b), ideally your function will work either if given (i) the name of a file that you’ve already downloaded or (ii) the HTML content produced by your function in (b).\nHint: a possibly useful argument for find_all is to request element(s) with certain attributes, e.g., html.find(\"p\", attrs = {'class': 'songtext'}) for finding a p element whose class is songtext.\nCreate a requirements file (based on either pip or Conda) that has the necessary information (in particular Python package versions) to reproduce the environment in which you ran your code. Include this file in your GitHub repository directory for this problem set.\n(Extra credit) If you’d like extra practice, write a Python function that will return the Google Scholar ID when the function is provided an html file as its argument. The file would be the file that is returned by searching for a researcher name as the input at scholar.google.com. As discussed in (a), your function should not query Google Scholar using the requests package, but rather should manipulate an HTML file that you download after manually querying Google Scholar yourself.\n(Extra credit) If you’d like extra practice, fix your function so that you get all of the results for a researcher and not just the first 20. E.g., for Michael Jordan there are several hundred.\n\nLook at the robots.txt for Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) and the references in Unit 2 on the ethics of webscraping. Does it seem like it’s ok to scrape data from Google Scholar? Hopefully this will make clear why our scraping in Problem 4 did not include programmatically obtaining the Google Scholar ID.",
